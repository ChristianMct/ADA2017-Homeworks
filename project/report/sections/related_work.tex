The Uppsala University has a Conflict Data Program\footnote{http://ucdp.uu.se/} which is the oldest and principal provider of war related data. It is considered as the global reference in terms of armed conflicts studies. Even though this ongoing project operates at a much larger scale, their results correlate with ours (mostly for peak values). The main difference lies in a finer granularity of considering "violent events", which include but are not limited to battles, resulting in differences in trends.

Another interesting related work is the "War and Peace" article from the \textit{ourworldindata.com} website\footnote{https://ourworldindata.org/war-and-peace/}. Their conclusions agree with ours to state that the past was not more peaceful than the contemporary era. Their data also show that the common belief that we live in the most dangerous times is the mere consequence of our human tendency to give less importance to past conflicts than present times ones.
