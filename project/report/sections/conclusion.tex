In this report, we have collected and processed the data from Wikipedia in order to compile a comprehensive and actionable dataset on battles throughout the last millennium. We have shown that battles have became lengthier and more complex, with the probably increasing difficulty of achieving tactical and strategic goals resulting in more indecisiveness. We also pointed out that, while the number of battle-related casualties decreased, the casualties-to-strengths ratio remained almost constants, and that these two statistics are critical for the outcome of the battle, even though there are not enough to achieve a major strategic victory.
