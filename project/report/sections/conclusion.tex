In this report, we have collected and processed the data from Wikipedia in order to retrieve useful information about battles through the human history. We have focused on the battles after year 1000 and observe interesting patterns that shown that while the battles are becoming lengthier and more complex, they are also making less casualties on the battle fields. In fact, we study the number of casualties among soldiers and we expect that the number of civilian casualties is higher in modern battles. This can be an interesting study for futur work. We have also noticed that the number of casualties is determinant for the victory of a battle. In fact, a combatant suffering less casualties has almost 80\% of chances to win.
