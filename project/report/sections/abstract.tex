Battles around the world and among centuries have engaged more than 209 millions of people and made more than 62 millions of casualties. Nowadays, only 10 countries are considered to be completely in peace. Even though the remaining countries are not all in an active war state, battles inside and among nations are an important matter today and have a major impact in human history. By collecting, formatting, observing and processing data from the open source and collaborative Wikipedia platform, we are able to better understand how the history of battles evolved among centuries and locations. In this report, we study more than 7,000 battles data in order to observe how battles evolved in terms of duration and number of casualties. We also notice that while the outcome of a battle can be of different types (decisive or strategic victory), the victory of a combatant mainly depends on the casualties that it suffers.
