For centuries, battles have been and still are the most direct and often extreme way for established powers to project or extend their influence. By collecting, processing and analyzing data from the open source and collaborative Wikipedia platform, we are able to better understand how battles were fought throughout the last millennium. In this document, we report on our analysis on more than 7000 battles, by notably exposing trends in duration, casualties over the years. Additionally, we show that the latter mostly determines the short-term winner, but not necessarily the long-term one.
