For centuries, battles have been and still are the most direct action taken by established powers to project or extend their influence. By collecting, processing and analyzing data from the open source, collaborative Wikipedia platform, we are able to better understand how battles were fought throughout the last millennium. In this document, we report our findings from an analysis made over more than 7000 battles. We expose trends in duration and casualties over the years. Additionally, we show that the latter is most important in determining the short-term winner which is not necessarily the long-term one.
