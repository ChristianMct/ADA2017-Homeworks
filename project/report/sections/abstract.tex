For centuries, battles have been and still are the most direct and often extreme way for established powers to project or extend their influence. While battle-related casualties are far to be representative of the damage caused in war-time, they have the particularity be part of a strategic and tactical planning. By collecting, processing and analyzing data from the open source and collaborative Wikipedia platform, we are able to better understand how the history of battles evolved among centuries and locations. In this report, we study more than 7,000 battles data in order to observe how battles evolved in terms of duration and number of casualties. We also notice that while the outcome of a battle can be of different types (decisive or strategic victory), the victory of a combatant mainly depends on the casualties that it suffers.
