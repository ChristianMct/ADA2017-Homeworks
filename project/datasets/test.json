Fought on 22 August 1485, the battle was won by the Lancastrians. Their leader [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond]], by his victory became the first English monarch of the [[Tudor dynasty]]. His opponent, [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], the last king of the House of York, was killed in the battle. Historians consider Bosworth Field to mark the end of the [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet dynasty]], making it a defining moment of English and Welsh history.\n\nRichard's reign began in 1483. At the request of his brother Edward IV, Richard was acting as  [[Lord Protector]] for his son Edward V. Richard had Parliament declare Edward V illegitimate and ineligible for the throne, and took it for himself. Richard lost popularity when the boy and his younger brother disappeared after he incarcerated them in the [[Tower of London]], and his support was further eroded by the popular belief that he was implicated in the death of his wife. Across the [[English Channel]] in [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]], Henry Tudor, a descendant of the greatly diminished House of Lancaster, seized on Richard's difficulties so that he could challenge his claim to the throne. Henry's first attempt to invade England was frustrated by a storm in 1483, but on his second attempt he arrived unopposed on 7 August 1485 on the southwest coast of Wales. Marching inland, Henry gathered support as he made for London. Richard mustered his troops and intercepted Henry's army south of [[Market Bosworth]] in Leicestershire. [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby|Thomas, Lord Stanley]], and [[William Stanley (Battle of Bosworth)|Sir William Stanley]] brought a force to the battlefield, but held back while they decided which side it would be more advantageous to support.\n\nRichard divided his army, which outnumbered Henry's, into three groups (or \"battles\"). One was assigned to the [[John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] and another to the [[Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]]. Henry kept most of his force together and placed it under the command of the experienced [[John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford|Earl of Oxford]]. Richard's vanguard, commanded by Norfolk, attacked but struggled against Oxford's men, and some of Norfolk's troops fled the field. Northumberland took no action when signalled to assist his king, so Richard gambled everything on a charge across the battlefield to kill Henry and end the fight. Seeing the king's knights separated from his army, the Stanleys intervened; Sir William led his men to Henry's aid, surrounding and killing Richard. After the battle Henry was crowned king below an oak tree in nearby Stoke Golding, now a residential garden.\n\nHenry hired chroniclers to portray his reign favourably; the Battle of Bosworth was popularised to represent the Tudor dynasty as the start of a new age. From the 15th to the 18th centuries the battle was glamorised as a victory of good over evil. The climax of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' provides a focal point for critics in later film adaptations. The exact site of the battle is disputed because of the lack of conclusive data, and memorials have been erected at different locations. In 1974 the Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre was built on a site that has since been challenged by several scholars and historians. In October 2009 a team of researchers, who had performed geological surveys and archaeological digs in the area from 2003, suggested a location {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} southwest of [[Ambion Hill]].\n\n==Background==\n{{further information|Wars of the Roses|Princes in the Tower}}\n<!-- This section is neither for determining Richard's involvement in the Princes' death, nor his motivations behind his taking the throne or the actions in doing so. [[Richard III of England]] and [[Princes in the Tower]] are the proper articles for that. -->\n{{Bosworth Template}}\nDuring the 15th century civil war raged across England as the [[House of York|Houses of York]] and [[House of Lancaster|Lancaster]] fought each other for the English throne. In 1471 the Yorkists defeated their rivals in the battles of [[Battle of Barnet|Barnet]] and [[Battle of Tewkesbury|Tewkesbury]]. The Lancastrian [[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI]] and his only son, [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales|Edward of Lancaster]], died in the aftermath of the Battle of Tewkesbury. Their deaths left the House of Lancaster with no direct claimants to the throne. The Yorkist king, [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], was in complete control of England.{{sfn|Ross|1997|pp=172–173}}  He [[Attainder|attainted]] those who refused to submit to his rule, such as [[Jasper Tudor]] and his nephew [[Henry VII of England|Henry]], naming them traitors and confiscating their lands. The Tudors tried to flee to France but strong winds forced them to land in [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]], then a semi-independent duchy, where they were taken into the custody of [[Francis II, Duke of Brittany|Duke Francis II]].{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=17}} Henry's mother, [[Lady Margaret Beaufort]], was a great-granddaughter of [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]], uncle of [[Richard II of England|King Richard II]] and father of [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]].{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=3}} The Beauforts were originally [[Bastard (Law of England and Wales)|bastards]], but Henry IV legitimised them on the condition that their descendants were not eligible to inherit the throne.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=21}}  Henry Tudor, the only remaining Lancastrian noble with a trace of the royal bloodline, had a weak claim to the throne,{{sfn|Ross|1997|pp=172–173}} and Edward regarded him as \"a nobody\".{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=192}} The Duke of Brittany, however, viewed Henry as a valuable tool to bargain for England's aid in conflicts with France and kept the Tudors under his protection.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=192}}\n\nEdward IV died 12 years after Tewkesbury on 9 April 1483.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=21}}  His 12-year-old elder son succeeded him as [[Edward V of England|King Edward V]]; the younger son, nine-year-old [[Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York|Richard of Shrewsbury]], was next in line to the throne. Edward V was [[Regency (government)|too young to rule]] and a [[Royal Council]] was established to rule the country until the king's coming of age. The royal court was worried when it learned that the Woodvilles, relatives of Edward IV's widow [[Elizabeth Woodville|Elizabeth]], were plotting to seize control of the council.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=65}} Having offended many in their quest for wealth and power, the Woodville family was not popular.{{sfn|Ross|1999|pp=35–43}} To frustrate the Woodvilles' ambitions, [[William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings|Lord Hastings]] and other members of the council turned to the new king's uncle—Richard, [[Richard III of England|Duke of Gloucester]], brother of Edward IV. The courtiers urged Gloucester to assume the role of Protector quickly, as had been previously requested by his now dead brother.{{sfn|Ross|1999|pp=40–41}} On 29 April Gloucester, accompanied by a contingent of guards and [[Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham]], took Edward V into custody and arrested several prominent members of the Woodville family.{{sfn|Ross|1999|pp=71–72}}  After bringing the young king to London, Gloucester had two of the Woodvilles (the Queen's brother [[Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers]] and her younger son by her first marriage [[Richard Grey]]) executed, without trial, on charges of treason.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=63}}\n\nOn 13 June Gloucester accused Hastings of plotting with the Woodvilles and had him beheaded.{{sfn|Ross|1999|pp=83–85}}  Nine days later Gloucester convinced [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] to declare the marriage between Edward IV and Elizabeth illegal, rendering their children illegitimate and disqualifying them from the throne.{{sfn|Ross|1999|pp=88–91}} With his brother's children out of the way, he was next in the line of succession and was proclaimed King Richard III on 26 June.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=93}}  The timing and extrajudicial nature of the deeds done to obtain the throne for Richard won him no popularity, and rumours that spoke ill of the new king spread throughout England.{{sfn|Ross|1999|pp=94–95}} After they were declared bastards, the two princes were confined in the [[Tower of London]] and never seen in public again.{{sfn|Ross|1999|pp=99–100}}\n\nDiscontent with Richard's actions manifested itself in the summer after he took control of the country, as a conspiracy emerged to displace him from the throne. The rebels were mostly loyalists to Edward IV, who saw Richard as a usurper.{{sfn|Ross|1999|pp=105–111}} Their plans were coordinated by a Lancastrian, Henry's mother Lady Margaret, who was promoting her son as a candidate for the throne. The highest-ranking conspirator was Buckingham. No chronicles tell of the duke's motive in joining the plot, although historian [[Charles Ross (historian)|Charles Ross]] proposes that Buckingham was trying to distance himself from a king who was becoming increasingly unpopular with the people.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=116}} Michael Jones and Malcolm Underwood suggest that Margaret deceived Buckingham into thinking the rebels supported him to be king.{{sfn|Jones|Underwood|1993|p=64}}\n\n[[File:Elizabeth of York, right facing portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A blond woman with rosy cheeks holds a white rose. She wears a gilded black shawl over her head and a red robe trimmed in white spotted fur.|[[Elizabeth of York]]: rumours of her marriage launched Henry's invasion.]]\nThe plan was to stage uprisings within a short time in southern and western England, overwhelming Richard's forces. Buckingham would support the rebels by invading from Wales, while Henry came in by sea.{{sfn|Ross|1999|pp=112–115}} Bad timing and weather wrecked the plot. An uprising in [[Kent]] started 10&nbsp;days prematurely, alerting Richard to muster the royal army and take steps to put down the insurrections. Richard's spies informed him of Buckingham's activities, and the king's men captured and destroyed the bridges across the [[River Severn]]. When Buckingham and his army reached the river, they found it swollen and impossible to cross because of a violent storm that broke on 15 October.{{sfn|Ross|1999|pp=115–116}} Buckingham was trapped and had no safe place to retreat; his Welsh enemies seized his home castle after he had set forth with his army. The duke abandoned his plans and fled to [[Wem]], where he was betrayed by his servant and arrested by Richard's men. On 2 November 1483 he was executed.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=117}} Henry had attempted a landing on 10 October (or 19 October), but his fleet was scattered by a storm. He reached the coast of England (at either [[Plymouth]] or [[Poole]]) and a group of soldiers hailed him to come ashore. They were, in fact, Richard's men, prepared to capture Henry once he set foot on English soil. Henry was not deceived and returned to Brittany, abandoning the invasion.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|pp=26–27}} Without Buckingham or Henry, the rebellion was easily crushed by Richard.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=117}}\n\nThe survivors of the failed uprisings fled to Brittany, where they openly supported Henry's claim to the throne.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=118}} At Christmas, Henry Tudor swore an oath to marry Edward IV's daughter, [[Elizabeth of York]], to unite the warring houses of York and Lancaster.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=196}} Henry's rising prominence made him a great threat to Richard, and the Yorkist king made several overtures to the Duke of Brittany to surrender the young Lancastrian. Francis refused, holding out for the possibility of better terms from Richard.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=19}} In mid-1484 Francis was incapacitated by illness and while recuperating, his treasurer [[Pierre Landais]] took over the reins of government. Landais reached an agreement with Richard to send back Henry and his uncle in exchange for military and financial aid. John Morton, a bishop of [[Flanders]],<!--not [[John Morton (archbishop)|John Morton]], who was Bishop of Ely at this time --> learned of the scheme and warned the Tudors, who fled to France.{{sfn|Lander|1981|p=324}} The French court allowed them to stay; the Tudors were useful pawns to ensure that Richard's England did not interfere with French plans to annex Brittany.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=31}}  On 16 March 1485 Richard's queen, [[Anne Neville]], died,{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=144}} and rumours spread across the country that she was murdered to pave the way for Richard to marry his niece, Elizabeth. The gossip alienated Richard from some of his northern supporters,{{sfn|Ross|1999|pp=145–146}} and upset Henry across the [[English Channel]].{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=38}} The loss of Elizabeth's hand in marriage could unravel the alliance between Henry's supporters who were Lancastrians and those who were loyalists to Edward IV.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=39}} Anxious to secure his bride, Henry recruited mercenaries formerly in French service to supplement his following of exiles and set sail from France on 1 August.{{sfn|Lander|1981|p=325}}\n\n==Factions==\n[[File:Richard vs Henry at Bosworth (lens corrected).jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=Two men in armour stand opposite each other.

Although a king could raise personal militia from his lands, he could only muster a significantly large army through the support of his nobles. Richard, like his predecessors, had to win over these men by granting gifts and maintaining cordial relationships.{{sfn|Downing|1992|pp=159–160}} Powerful nobles could demand greater incentives to remain on the liege's side or else they might turn against him.{{sfn|Downing|1992|p=59}} Three groups, each with its own agenda, stood on Bosworth Field: Richard III and his Yorkist army; his challenger, Henry Tudor, who championed the Lancastrian cause; and the fence-sitting Stanleys.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=47}}\n\n===Yorkist===\nSmall and slender, Richard III did not have the robust physique associated with many of his Plantagenet predecessors.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=138}}  However, he enjoyed very rough sports and activities that were considered manly.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=142}} His performances on the battlefield impressed his brother greatly, and he became Edward's right-hand man.{{sfn|Ross|1999|pp=21–22}} During the 1480s Richard defended the northern borders of England. In 1482 Edward charged him to lead an army into Scotland with the aim of replacing [[James III of Scotland|King James III]] with the [[Alexander Stewart, Duke of Albany|Duke of Albany]].{{sfn|Ross|1999|pp=44–45}} Richard's army [[Capture of Berwick (1482)|broke through the Scottish defences and occupied the capital]], Edinburgh, but Albany decided to give up his claim to the throne in return for the post of Lieutenant General of Scotland. As well as obtaining a guarantee that the Scottish government would concede territories and diplomatic benefits to the English crown, Richard's campaign retook the town of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]], which the Scots had conquered in 1460.{{sfn|Ross|1999|pp=45–47}} Edward was not satisfied by these gains,{{sfn|Lander|1981|p=327}} which, according to Ross, could have been greater if Richard had been resolute enough to capitalise on the situation while in control of Edinburgh.{{sfn|Ross|1997|pp=289–290}} In her analysis of Richard's character, Christine Carpenter sees him as a soldier who was more used to taking orders than giving them.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=210}} However, he was not averse to displaying his militaristic streak; on ascending the throne he made known his desire to lead a [[Crusades|crusade]] against \"not only the Turks, but all [his] foes\".{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=142}}\n\nRichard's most loyal subject was [[John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk]].{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=168}} The duke had served Richard's brother for many years and had been one of Edward IV's closer confidants.{{sfn|Ross|1997|p=226}} He was a military veteran, having fought in the [[Battle of Towton]] in 1461 and served as Hastings' deputy at Calais in 1471.{{sfn|Ross|1997|pp=36, 181}} Ross speculates that he may have borne a grudge against Edward for depriving him of a fortune. Norfolk was due to inherit a share of the wealthy Mowbray estate on the death of eight-year-old [[Anne de Mowbray, 8th Countess of Norfolk|Anne de Mowbray]], the last of her family. However, Edward convinced Parliament to circumvent the law of inheritance and transfer the estate to his younger son, who was married to Anne. Consequently, Howard supported Richard III in deposing Edward's sons, for which he received the dukedom of Norfolk and his original share of the Mowbray estate.{{sfn|Ross|1999|pp=35–38, 175}}\n\n[[Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland]], also supported Richard's seizure of the throne of England. The Percys were loyal Lancastrians, but Edward IV eventually won the earl's allegiance. Northumberland had been captured and imprisoned by the Yorkists in 1461, losing his titles and estates; however, Edward released him eight years later and restored his earldom.{{sfn|Hicks|2002|p=280}} From that time Northumberland served the Yorkist crown, helping to defend northern England and maintain its peace.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=180}} Initially the earl had issues with Richard III as Edward groomed his brother to be the leading power of the north. Northumberland was mollified when he was promised he would be the [[Lord Warden of the Marches|Warden of the East March]], a position that was formerly hereditary for the Percys.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=185}} He served under Richard during the 1482 invasion of Scotland, and the allure of being in a position to dominate the north of England if Richard went south to assume the crown was his likely motivation for supporting Richard's bid for kingship.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=78}} However, after becoming king, Richard began moulding his nephew, [[John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln]], to manage the north, passing over Northumberland for the position. According to Carpenter, although the earl was amply compensated, he despaired of any possibility of advancement under Richard.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=215}}\n\n===Lancastrian===\nHenry Tudor was unfamiliar with the arts of war and a stranger to the land he was trying to conquer. He spent the first fourteen years of his life in Wales and the next fourteen in Brittany and France.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|pp=3, 15–17}}  Slender but strong and decisive, Henry lacked a penchant for battle and was not much of a warrior; chroniclers such as [[Polydore Vergil]] and ambassadors like [[Pedro de Ayala]] found him more interested in commerce and finance.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|pp=299, 301, 318}}  Having not fought in any battles,{{sfn|Saccio|2000|p=183}} Henry recruited several experienced veterans on whom he could rely for military advice and the command of his armies.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=211}} \n<!-- Mediaeval historian Thomas Brynmor Pugh believes that instead of participating in the battle, Jasper stayed behind in Wales to secure an escape route for his nephew, in case the battle was lost.{{sfn|Pugh|1992|p=50}}-->\n[[John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford]], was Henry's principal military commander.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=54}}  He was adept in the arts of war. At the Battle of Barnet, he commanded the Lancastrian right wing and routed the division opposing him. However, as a result of confusion over identities, Oxford's group came under [[friendly fire]] from the Lancastrian main force and retreated from the field. The earl fled abroad and continued his fight against the Yorkists, raiding shipping and eventually capturing the island fort of [[St Michael's Mount]] in 1473. He surrendered after receiving no aid or reinforcement, but in 1484 escaped from prison and joined Henry's court in France, bringing along his erstwhile gaoler [[James Blount|Sir James Blount]].{{sfn|Britnell|1997|p=101}}  Oxford's presence raised morale in Henry's camp and troubled Richard III.{{sfn|Gravett|1999|p=15}}\n\n===Stanleys===\nIn the early stages of the Wars of the Roses, the Stanleys of Cheshire had been predominantly Lancastrians.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=159}}  Sir [[William Stanley (Battle of Bosworth)|William Stanley]], however, was a staunch Yorkist supporter, fighting in the [[Battle of Blore Heath]] in 1459 and helping Hastings to put down uprisings against Edward IV in 1471.<ref>{{harvnb|Hicks|2002|p=163}}; {{harvnb|Ross|1997|p=164}}.</ref> When Richard took the crown, Sir William showed no inclination to turn against the new king, refraining from joining Buckingham's rebellion, for which he was amply rewarded.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=212}}  Sir William's elder brother, [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby|Thomas Stanley, 2nd Baron Stanley]], was not as steadfast. By 1485, he had served three kings, namely Henry VI, Edward IV, and Richard III. Lord Stanley's skilled political manoeuvrings—vacillating between opposing sides until it was clear who would be the winner—gained him high positions;{{sfn|Coward|1983|pp=2, 9–10}} he was Henry's chamberlain and Edward's steward.{{sfn|Ross|1997|p=334}}  His non-committal stance, until the crucial point of a battle, earned him the loyalty of his men, who felt he would not needlessly send them to their deaths.{{sfn|Gravett|1999|p=15}}\n\nEven though Lord Stanley had served as Edward IV's steward, his relations with the king's brother, the eventual Richard III, were not cordial. The two had conflicts that erupted into violence around March 1470.{{sfn|Ross|1997|p=134}}  Furthermore, having taken Lady Margaret as his second wife in June 1472,{{sfn|Jones|Underwood|1993|p=59}} Stanley was Henry Tudor's stepfather, a relationship which did nothing to win him Richard's favour. Despite these differences, Stanley did not join [[Buckingham's revolt]] in 1483.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=212}}  When Richard executed those conspirators who had been unable to flee England,{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=117}} he spared Lady Margaret. However, he declared her titles forfeit and transferred her estates to Stanley's name, to be held in trust for the Yorkist crown. Richard's act of mercy was calculated to reconcile him with Stanley,{{sfn|Jones|Underwood|1993|p=64}} but it may have been to no avail—Carpenter has identified a further cause of friction in Richard's intention to reopen an old land dispute that involved Thomas Stanley and the Harrington family.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=216}}  Edward IV had ruled the case in favour of Stanley in 1473,{{sfn|Ross|1997|p=409}} but Richard planned to overturn his brother's ruling and give the wealthy estate to the Harringtons.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=216}}  Immediately before the Battle of Bosworth, being wary of Stanley, Richard took his son, [[George Stanley, 9th Baron Strange|Lord Strange]], as hostage to discourage him from joining Henry.{{sfn|Horrox|1991|p=323}}\n\n==Crossing the Channel and through Wales==\nReports of the number of soldiers Henry brought with him vary widely, with different sources giving figures of 1,000, 3,000, 3,600, 4,000 and 5,000 men.{{sfn|Hicks|2010|p=231}} This initial force consisted of the English and Welsh exiles who had gathered around Henry, combined with a contingent of mercenaries put at his disposal by [[Charles VIII of France]]. The history of one \"John Major\" (published in 1521) claims that Charles had granted Henry 5,000 men, of whom 1,000 were Scots, headed by Sir Alexander Bruce. No mention of Scottish soldiers was made by subsequent English historians.{{sfn|Skidmore|2013|p=224}} After the battle, Bruce was given an annuity of £20 by Henry for his \"faithful services\". How many Frenchmen actually sailed is unknown, but the historian [[Chris Skidmore]] estimates over half of Henry's armed fleet. The [[Croyland Chronicle|Crowland Chronicler]] also recorded that Henry's troops were \"as much French as English\". Many of these French mercenaries were from the garrison of [[Philippe de Crèvecœur d'Esquerdes|Philippe de Crevecoeur, Lord of Esquerdes]]. [[Commynes]] recorded that these included \"some 3,000 of the most unruly men in Normandy\".{{sfn|Skidmore|2013|p=234}}\n\nHenry's crossing of the English Channel in 1485 was without incident. Thirty ships sailed from [[Harfleur]] on 1 August and, with fair winds behind them, landed in his native Wales, at Mill Bay (near [[Dale, Pembrokeshire|Dale]]) on the north side of [[Milford Haven]] on 7 August, easily capturing nearby [[Dale Castle]]. His long-awaited arrival had been hailed by contemporary Welsh bards such as Dafydd Ddu and [[Gruffydd ap Dafydd]] as the true prince and \"the youth of Brittany defeating the Saxons\" in order to bring their country back to glory.{{sfn|Elton|2003|p=89}}{{sfn|Skidmore|2013|p=207}} Mill Bay had been chosen as it was completely hidden from view and there was no resistance by the cohort of Richard's men stationed at Dale where Henry and his men spent the first night.\n\nIn the morning they marched to [[Haverfordwest]], the county town of [[Pembrokeshire]], 12 miles away and were received \"with the utmost goodwill of all\". Here, the Welshman Arnold Butler (who had met Henry in Brittany) announced that \"the whole of Pembrokeshire was prepared to serve him\". Butler's closest friend was [[Rhys ap Thomas]]. That afternoon, Henry and his troops headed north towards [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]] and pitched camp \"at the fifth milestone towards Cardigan\" where they were joined by Gruffydd Rede with a band of soldiers and John Morgan of [[Tredegar]]. The following day, 9 August, they passed through Bwlch-y-gwynt and over the [[Preseli Hills|Preseli mountains]] and to Fagwyr Llwyd south of Cilgwyn.\n\nRichard's lieutenant in South Wales, Sir Walter Herbert, failed to move against Henry, and two of his officers, Richard Griffith and Evan Morgan, deserted to Henry with their men.{{sfn|Rowse|1998|p=215}}\n\nHowever, the most important defector to Henry in this early stage of the campaign was probably Rhys ap Thomas, who was the leading figure in West Wales.{{sfn|Rowse|1998|p=215}} Richard had appointed Rhys Lieutenant in West Wales for his refusal to join Buckingham's rebellion, asking that he surrender his son [[Gruffydd ap Rhys ap Thomas]] as surety, although by some accounts Rhys had managed to evade this condition. However, Henry successfully courted Rhys, offering the lieutenancy of all Wales in exchange for his fealty. Henry marched via [[Aberystwyth]] while Rhys followed a more southerly route, recruiting a force of Welshmen en route, variously estimated at 500 or 2,000 men, to swell Henry's army when they reunited at [[Long Mountain (Powys)|Cefn Digoll]], [[Welshpool]],.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|pp=42–43}} By 15 or 16 August, Henry and his men had crossed the English border, making for the town of [[Shrewsbury]].{{sfn|Gravett|1999|p=40}}\n\n==Shrewsbury: the gateway to England==\n[[File:Henry Tudor and Rhys ap Thomas' march through Wales translated from Welsh.svg|thumb|500px|March through Wales, to Bosworth Field.]]\nSince 22 June 1485 Richard had been aware of Henry's impending invasion, and had ordered his lords to maintain a high level of readiness.{{sfn|Ross|1999|pp=208–209}}  News of Henry's landing reached Richard on 11 August, but it took three to four days for his messengers to notify his lords of their king's mobilisation. On 16 August, the Yorkist army started to gather; Norfolk set off for [[Leicester]], the assembly point, that night. The city of York, a traditional stronghold of Richard's family, asked the king for instructions, and receiving a reply three days later sent 80&nbsp;men to join the king. Simultaneously Northumberland, whose northern territory was the most distant from the capital, had gathered his men and ridden to Leicester.{{sfn|Ross|1999|pp=212–215}}\n\nAlthough London was his goal,{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=44}} Henry did not move directly towards the city. After resting in Shrewsbury, his forces went eastwards and picked up [[Gilbert Talbot (soldier)|Sir Gilbert Talbot]] and other English allies, including deserters from Richard's forces. Although its size had increased substantially since the landing, Henry's army was still substantially outnumbered by Richard's forces. Henry's pace through [[Staffordshire]] was slow, delaying the confrontation with Richard so that he could gather more recruits to his cause.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=212}} Henry had been communicating on friendly terms with the Stanleys for some time before setting foot in England,{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=39}} and the Stanleys had mobilised their forces on hearing of Henry's landing. They ranged themselves ahead of Henry's march through the English countryside,{{sfn|Gravett|1999|pp=44–45}} meeting twice in secret with Henry as he moved through Staffordshire.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=217}}  At the second of these, at [[Atherstone]] in Warwickshire, they conferred \"in what sort to arraign battle with King Richard, whom they heard to be not far off\".{{sfn|Rowse|1998|loc=p. 217: a quote from Vergil}}  On 21 August, the Stanleys were making camp on the slopes of a hill north of [[Dadlington]], while Henry encamped his army at White Moors to the northwest of their camp.{{sfn|Gravett|1999|p=45}}\n[[File:Bosworth Field - Prelude.svg|thumb|upright|240px|alt=Battlefield map.

Norfolk's group (or \"battle\" in the parlance of the time) of spearmen stood on the right flank, protecting the cannon and about 1,200&nbsp;archers. Richard's group, comprising 3,000&nbsp;infantry, formed the centre. Northumberland's men guarded the left flank; he had approximately 4,000&nbsp;men, many of them mounted.<ref>{{harvnb|Gravett|1999|pp=54–55}}; {{harvnb|Ross|1999|pp=217–218}}.</ref> Standing on the hilltop, Richard had a wide, unobstructed view of the area. He could see the Stanleys and their 4,000–6,000 men holding positions on and around Dadlington Hill, while to the southwest was Henry's army.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=217}}\n\nHenry's force has been variously estimated at between 5,000 and 8,000 men, his original landing force of exiles and mercenaries having been augmented by the recruits gathered in Wales and the English border counties (in the latter area probably mustered chiefly by the Talbot interest), and by deserters from Richard's army. Historian John Mackie believes that 1,800&nbsp;French mercenaries, led by Philibert de Chandée, formed the core of Henry's army.{{sfn|Mackie|1983|p=51}} [[John Major (philosopher)|John Mair]], writing thirty-five years after the battle, claimed that this force contained a significant Scottish component,{{sfn|Major|1892|p=393}} and this claim is accepted by some modern writers,{{sfn|Gravett|1999|pp=34–36}} but Mackie reasons that the French would not have released their [[Garde Ecossaise|elite Scottish knights and archers]], and concludes that there were probably few Scottish troops in the army, although he accepts the presence of captains like [[Bernard Stewart, Lord of Aubigny]].{{sfn|Mackie|1983|p=51}}{{sfn|Major|1892|p=393}}\n\nIn their interpretations of the vague mentions of the battle in the old text, historians placed areas near the foot of Ambion Hill as likely regions where the two armies clashed, and thought up possible scenarios of the engagement.{{sfn|Hicks|1995|p=23}}{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=216}}{{sfn|Gravett|1999|pp=46–52}}  In their recreations of the battle, Henry started by moving his army towards Ambion Hill where Richard and his men stood. As Henry's army advanced past the marsh at the southwestern foot of the hill, Richard sent a message to Stanley, threatening to execute his son, [[George Stanley, 9th Baron Strange|Lord Strange]], if Stanley did not join the attack on Henry immediately. Stanley replied that he had other sons. Incensed, Richard gave the order to behead Strange but his officers temporised, saying that battle was imminent, and it would be more convenient to carry out the execution afterwards.{{sfn|Rowse|1998|p=219}}  Henry had also sent messengers to Stanley asking him to declare his allegiance. The reply was evasive—the Stanleys would \"naturally\" come, after Henry had given orders to his army and arranged them for battle. Henry had no choice but to confront Richard's forces alone.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=47}}\n\nWell aware of his own military inexperience, Henry handed command of his army to Oxford and retired to the rear with his bodyguards. Oxford, seeing the vast line of Richard's army strung along the ridgeline, decided to keep his men together instead of splitting them into the traditional three battles: vanguard, centre, and rearguard. He ordered the troops to stray no further than {{convert|10|ft|m}} from their banners, fearing that they would become enveloped. Individual groups clumped together, forming a single large mass flanked by horsemen on the wings.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=48}}\n\nThe Lancastrians were harassed by Richard's cannon as they manoeuvred around the marsh, seeking firmer ground.{{sfn|Ross|1999|pp=220–221}}  Once Oxford and his men were clear of the marsh, Norfolk's battle and several contingents of Richard's group, under the command of Sir [[Robert Brackenbury]], started to advance. Hails of arrows showered both sides as they closed. Oxford's men proved the steadier in the ensuing hand-to-hand combat; they held their ground and several of Norfolk's men fled the field.{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=19}} Norfolk lost one his senior officers, [[Walter Devereux, 7th Baron Ferrers of Chartley|Walter Devereux]] in this early clash.<ref>C. Markham ''Richard III'', p. 252 </ref>\n\nRecognising that his force was at a disadvantage, Richard signalled for Northumberland to assist but Northumberland's group showed no signs of movement. Historians, such as Horrox and Pugh, believe Northumberland chose not to aid his king for personal reasons.<ref>{{harvnb|Horrox|1991|pp=319–320}}; Pugh (1992), p. 49.</ref> Ross doubts the aspersions cast on Northumberland's loyalty, suggesting instead that Ambion Hill's narrow ridge hindered him from joining the battle. The earl would have had to either go through his allies or execute a wide flanking move—near impossible to perform given the standard of drill at the time—to engage Oxford's men.{{sfn|Ross|1999|pp=221–223}}\n\nAt this juncture Richard saw Henry at some distance behind his main force.{{sfn|JonesLangley||2013|p=201}} Seeing this, Richard decided to end the fight quickly by [[single combat|killing the enemy commander]]. He led a charge of mounted men around the melee and tore into Henry's group; several accounts state that Richard's force numbered 800–1000&nbsp;knights, but Ross says it was more likely that Richard was accompanied only by his household men and closest friends.<ref>{{harvnb|Gravett|1999|p=69}};{{harvnb|Ross|1999|pp=222–224}}.</ref> Richard killed Henry's standard-bearer [[William Brandon (standard-bearer)|Sir William Brandon]] in the initial charge and unhorsed burly [[John Cheyne, Baron Cheyne|John Cheyne]], Edward IV's former standard-bearer,{{sfn|Horrox|1991|p=325}} with a blow to the head from his broken lance.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=49}} French mercenaries in Henry's retinue related how the attack had caught them off guard and that Henry sought protection by dismounting and concealing himself among them to present less of a target. Henry made no attempt to engage in combat himself.{{sfn|Jones|Langley|2013|pp=202, 205}}\n\nOxford had left a small reserve of [[Pike (weapon)|pike]]-equipped men with Henry. They slowed the pace of Richard's mounted charge and bought Tudor some critical time.{{sfn|Jones|Langley|2013|p=203}} The remainder of Henry's bodyguards surrounded their master and succeeded in keeping him away from the Yorkist king. On seeing Richard embroiled with Henry's men and separated from his main force, William Stanley made his move. He led his men into the fight at Henry's side. Outnumbered, Richard's group was surrounded and gradually pressed back.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=49}} Richard's force was driven several hundred yards away from Tudor, near to the edge of a marsh. The king's horse lost its footing and toppled into it. Richard gathered himself and rallied his dwindling followers, supposedly refusing to retreat: \"God forbid that I retreat one step. I will either win the battle as a king, or die as one.\"{{sfn|Jones|Langley|2013|p=206}} In the fighting Richard's banner man—Sir [[Percival Thirlwall]]—lost his legs but held the Yorkist banner aloft until he was killed.

Parliament reversed his attainder and recorded Richard's kingship as illegal, although the Yorkist king's reign remained officially in the annals of England history. The proclamation of Edward IV's children as illegitimate was also reversed, restoring Elizabeth's status to a royal princess.{{sfn|Baker|2003|pp=58–59}}  The marriage of Elizabeth, the heiress to the House of York, to Henry, the master of the House of Lancaster, marked the end of the feud between the two houses and the start of the [[Tudor dynasty]]. The royal matrimony, however, was delayed until Henry was crowned king and had established his claim on the throne firmly enough to preclude that of Elizabeth and her kin.{{sfn|Laynesmith|2005|p=81}}  Henry further convinced Parliament to backdate his reign to the day before the battle,{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=20}}  enabling him retrospectively to declare as traitors those who had fought against him at Bosworth Field.{{sfn|Baker|2003|p=59}}  Northumberland, who had remained inactive during the battle, was imprisoned but later released and reinstated to pacify the north in Henry's name.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=222}}  The purge of those who fought for Richard occupied Henry's first two years of rule, although later he proved prepared to accept those who submitted to him regardless of their former allegiances.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|pp=224–225}}\n\nOf his supporters, Henry rewarded the Stanleys the most generously.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=54}} Aside from making William his chamberlain, he bestowed the earldom of Derby upon Lord Stanley along with grants and offices in other estates.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=223}}  Henry rewarded Oxford by restoring to him the lands and titles confiscated by the Yorkists and appointing him as [[Constable of the Tower]] and admiral of England, Ireland, and [[Aquitaine]]. For his kin, Henry created Jasper Tudor the Duke of Bedford.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|pp=54–55}}  He returned to his mother the lands and grants stripped from her by Richard, and proved to be a filial son, granting her a place of honour in the palace and faithfully attending to her throughout his reign. Parliament's declaration of Margaret as ''[[femme sole]]'' effectively empowered her; she no longer needed to manage her estates through Stanley.{{sfn|Jones|Underwood|1993|pp=98–99}}  Elton points out that despite his initial largesse, Henry's supporters at Bosworth would only enjoy his special favour for the short term; in later years, he would instead promote those who best served his interests.{{sfn|Elton|2003|pp=78–80}}\n\nLike the kings before him, Henry faced dissenters. The first open revolt occurred two years after Bosworth Field; [[Lambert Simnel]] claimed to be [[Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick]], who was Edward IV's nephew. The Earl of Lincoln backed him for the throne and led rebel forces in the name of the House of York.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=222}}  The rebel army fended off several attacks by Northumberland's forces, before engaging Henry's army at the [[Battle of Stoke Field]] on 16 June 1487.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=223}}  Oxford and Bedford led Henry's men,{{sfn|Mackie|1983|p=73}} including several former supporters of Richard III.{{sfn|Horrox|1991|p=318}}  Henry won this battle easily, but other malcontents and conspiracies would follow.{{sfn|Pugh|1992|pp=52–56}}  A rebellion in 1489 started with Northumberland's murder; military historian Michael C. C. Adams says that the author of a note, which was left next to Northumberland's body, blamed the earl for Richard's death.{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=20}}\n\n==Legacy and historical significance==\nContemporary accounts of the Battle of Bosworth can be found in four main sources, one of which is the English ''[[Croyland Chronicle]]'', written by a senior Yorkist chronicler who relied on second-hand information from nobles and soldiers.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=6}}  The other accounts were written by foreigners—Vergil, Jean Molinet, and Diego de Valera.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|pp=4, 7}}  Whereas Molinet was sympathetic to Richard,{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=7}} Vergil was in Henry's service and drew information from the king and his subjects to portray them in a good light.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=4}}  Diego de Valera, whose information Ross regards as unreliable,{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=216}} compiled his work from letters of Spanish merchants.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=7}}  However, other historians have used Valera's work to deduce possibly valuable insights not readily evident in other sources.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=8}}  Ross finds the poem, ''The Ballad of Bosworth Field'', a useful source to ascertain certain details of the battle. The multitude of different accounts, mostly based on second- or third-hand information, has proved an obstacle to historians as they try to reconstruct the battle.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=216}}  Their common complaint is that, except for its outcome, very few details of the battle are found in the chronicles.

By portraying Richard as a hunchbacked tyrant who usurped the throne by killing his nephews, the Tudor historians attached a sense of myth to the battle: it became an epic clash between good and evil with a satisfying moral outcome.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=11}}  According to [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] Colin Burrow, André was so overwhelmed by the historic significance of the battle that he represented it with a blank page in his ''Henry VII'' (1502).{{sfn|Burrow|2000|p=12}}  For Professor Peter Saccio, the battle was indeed a unique clash in the annals of English history, because \"the victory was determined, not by those who fought, but by those who delayed fighting until they were sure of being on the winning side.\"{{sfn|Saccio|2000|p=183}}\n\nHistorians such as Adams and Horrox believe that Richard lost the battle not for any mythic reasons, but because of morale and loyalty problems in his army. Most of the common soldiers found it difficult to fight for a liege whom they distrusted, and some lords believed that their situation might improve if Richard was dethroned.{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=19}}{{sfn|Horrox|1991|p=318}}  According to Adams, against such duplicities Richard's desperate charge was the only knightly behaviour on the field. As fellow historian Michael Bennet puts it, the attack was \"the swan-song of [mediaeval] English chivalry\".{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=20}}  Adams believes this view was shared at the time by the printer [[William Caxton]], who enjoyed sponsorship from Edward IV and Richard III. Nine days after the battle, Caxton published [[Thomas Malory]]'s story about chivalry and death by betrayal—''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''—seemingly as a response to the circumstances of Richard's death.{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=20}}\n\nElton does not believe Bosworth Field has any true significance, pointing out that the 20th-century English public largely ignored the battle until its quincentennial celebration. In his view, the dearth of specific information about the battle—no-one even knows exactly where it took place—demonstrates its insignificance to English society. Elton considers the battle as just one part of Henry's struggles to establish his reign, underscoring his point by noting that the young king had to spend ten more years pacifying factions and rebellions to secure his throne.{{sfn|Elton|2003|p=78}}\n\nMackie asserts that, in hindsight, Bosworth Field is notable as the decisive battle that established a dynasty which would rule unchallenged over England for more than a hundred years.{{sfn|Mackie|1983|p=8}} Mackie notes that contemporary historians of that time, wary of the three royal successions during the long Wars of the Roses, considered Bosworth Field just another in a lengthy series of such battles. It was through the works and efforts of [[Francis Bacon]] and his successors that the public started to believe the battle had decided their futures by bringing about \"the fall of a tyrant\".{{sfn|Mackie|1983|p=7}}\n\n===Shakespearian dramatisation===\n[[William Shakespeare]] gives prominence to the Battle of Bosworth in his play, ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''. It is the \"one big battle\"; no other fighting scene distracts the audience from this action,{{sfn|Grene|2002|p=92}} represented by a one-on-one sword fight between Henry Tudor and Richard III.{{sfn|Edelman|1992|p=80}}  Shakespeare uses their duel to bring a climactic end to the play and the Wars of the Roses; he also uses it to champion morality, portraying the \"unequivocal triumph of good over evil\".{{sfn|Grene|2002|p=93}}  Richard, the villainous lead character, has been built up in the battles of Shakespeare's earlier play, ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'', as a \"formidable swordsman and a courageous military leader\"—in contrast to the dastardly means by which he becomes king in ''Richard III''.{{sfn|Edelman|1992|p=79}}  Although the Battle of Bosworth has only five sentences to direct it, three scenes and more than four hundred lines precede the action, developing the background and motivations for the characters in anticipation of the battle.{{sfn|Grene|2002|p=93}}\n\n[[File:William Hogarth - David Garrick as Richard III - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A moustached man—dressed in white stockings, puffed breeches, and a red robe—props himself up with his left arm on a bed.

A suit of armour lays on the floor at the foot of his bed.|''Richard III'', Act 5, scene 3: Richard, played by [[David Garrick]], awakens after a nightmare visit by the ghosts of his victims.]]\nShakespeare's account of the battle was mostly based on chroniclers [[Edward Hall]]'s and [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s dramatic versions of history, which were sourced from Vergil's chronicle. However, Shakespeare's attitude towards Richard was shaped by scholar [[Thomas More]], whose writings displayed extreme bias against the Yorkist king.{{sfn|Lull|Shakespeare|1999|p=1}}  The result of these influences is a script that vilifies the king, and Shakespeare had few qualms about departing from history to incite drama.{{sfn|Saccio|2000|p=14}}  [[Margaret of Anjou]] died in 1482, but Shakespeare had her speak to Richard's mother before the battle to foreshadow Richard's fate and fulfill the prophecy she had given in ''Henry VI''.{{sfn|Lull|Shakespeare|1999|p=48}}  Shakespeare exaggerated the cause of Richard's restless night before the battle, imagining it as a haunting by the ghosts of those whom the king had murdered, including Buckingham.{{sfn|Grene|2002|p=154}}  Richard is portrayed as suffering a pang of conscience, but as he speaks he regains his confidence and asserts that he will be evil, if such needed to retain his crown.{{sfn|Lull|Shakespeare|1999|p=18}}\n\nThe fight between the two armies is simulated by rowdy noises made off-stage (''alarums'' or alarms) while actors walk on-stage, deliver their lines, and exit. To build anticipation for the duel, Shakespeare requests more ''alarums'' after Richard's councillor, [[William Catesby]], announces that the king is \"[enacting] more wonders than a man\". Richard punctuates his entrance with the classic line, \"A horse, a horse! My kingdom for a horse!\"{{sfn|Edelman|1992|p=80}}  He refuses to withdraw, continuing to seek to slay Henry's doubles until he has killed his nemesis. There is no documentary evidence that Henry had five [[Political decoy|decoys]] at Bosworth Field; the idea was Shakespeare's invention. He drew inspiration from [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]'s use of them at the [[Battle of Shrewsbury]] (1403) to amplify the perception of Richard's courage on the battlefield.{{sfn|Edelman|1992|p=81}}  Similarly, the single combat between Henry and Richard is Shakespeare's creation. ''[[The True Tragedy of Richard III]]'', by an unknown playwright, earlier than Shakespeare's, has no signs of staging such an encounter: its stage directions give no hint of visible combat.{{sfn|Edelman|1992|pp=16–17}}\n\n[[File:The Battle of Bosworth Field - A Scene from the Great Drama of History.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A view from the back of a stage.

Men dressed as soldiers lounge and drink behind the props.|''The Battle of Bosworth Field, a Scene in the Great Drama of History'', illustrating Beckett's mocking of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] attitude towards history]]\nDespite the dramatic licences taken, Shakespeare's version of the Battle of Bosworth was the model of the event for English textbooks for many years during the 18th and 19th centuries.{{sfn|Mitchell|2000|p=209}}  This glamorised version of history, promulgated in books and paintings and played out on stages across the country, perturbed humorist [[Gilbert Abbott à Beckett]].{{sfn|Mitchell|2000|p=208}}  He voiced his criticism in the form of a poem, equating the romantic view of the battle to watching a \"fifth-rate production of ''Richard III''\": shabbily costumed actors fight the Battle of Bosworth on-stage while those with lesser roles lounge at the back, showing no interest in the proceedings.{{sfn|Mitchell|2000|pp=209–210}}\n\nIn [[Laurence Olivier]]'s [[Richard III (1955 film)|1955 film adaptation]] of ''Richard III'', the Battle of Bosworth is represented not by a single duel but a general melee that became the film's most recognised scene and a regular screening at Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre.<ref>{{harvnb|Davies|1990|p=74}}; {{harvnb|English Heritage|1995|p=10}}.</ref> The film depicts the clash between the Yorkist and Lancastrian armies on an open field, focusing on individual characters amidst the savagery of hand-to-hand fighting, and received accolades for the realism portrayed.{{sfn|Davies|1990|pp=74–75, 135}}  One reviewer for ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'' newspaper, however, was not impressed, finding the number of combatants too sparse for the wide plains and a lack of subtlety in Richard's death scene.{{sfn|Davies|2000|p=176}}  The means by which Richard is shown to prepare his army for the battle also earned acclaim. As Richard speaks to his men and draws his plans in the sand using his sword, his units appear on-screen, arraying themselves according to the lines that Richard had drawn. Intimately woven together, the combination of pictorial and narrative elements effectively turns Richard into a storyteller, who acts out the plot he has constructed.{{sfn|Davies|1990|p=75}}  Shakespearian critic Herbert Coursen extends that imagery: Richard sets himself up as a creator of men, but dies amongst the savagery of his creations. Coursen finds the depiction a contrast to that of [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] and his \"band of brothers\".{{sfn|Coursen|2000|pp=100–101}}\n\nThe adaptation of the setting for ''Richard III'' to a 1930s fascist England in [[Ian McKellen]]'s [[Richard III (1995 film)|1995 film]], however, did not sit well with historians. Adams posits that the original Shakespearian setting for Richard's fate at Bosworth teaches the moral of facing one's fate, no matter how unjust it is, \"nobly and with dignity\".{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=28}}  By overshadowing the dramatic teaching with special effects, McKellen's film reduces its version of the battle to a pyrotechnic spectacle about the death of a one-dimensional villain.{{sfn|Adams|2002|pp=28–29}}  Coursen agrees that, in this version, the battle and Richard's end are trite and underwhelming.{{sfn|Coursen|2000|pp=102–103}}\n\n==Battlefield location==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| header    = Richard's Field\n| footer    = The memorial and its plaque\n| footer_align = left\n| width     = 200\n| image1    = King Richard's Field.jpg\n| alt1      = A clearing sparsely surrounded by trees and bushes.

Sparked by the battle's quincentenary celebration in 1985,{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=1}} a dispute among historians has led many to suspect the accuracy of Williams's theory.{{sfn|Dunn|2000|p=2}}{{sfn|Battlefields Trust|2004|loc=\"[http://www.battlefieldstrust.com/resource-centre/warsoftheroses/battlepageview.asp?pageid=387 Visiting the Battlefield]\"}}  In particular, geological surveys conducted from 2003 to 2009 by the Battlefields Trust, a charitable organisation that protects and studies old English battlefields, show that the southern and eastern flanks of Ambion Hill were solid ground in the 15th century, contrary to Williams's claim that it was a large area of marshland.{{sfn|Foard|2004|p=21}} [[Landscape archaeology|Landscape archaeologist]] [[Glenn Foard]], leader of the survey,{{sfn|Williamson|2008|p=2}} said the collected soil samples and finds of medieval military equipment suggest that the battle took place {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} southwest of Ambion Hill (52°34′41″N 1°26′02″W),{{sfn|Foard|2010|p=29}} contrary to the popular belief that it was fought near the foot of the hill.<ref>{{harvnb|Wainwright|2009}}; {{harvnb|Walker|2009}}.</ref>[[File:Bosworth Battlefield true location.jpg|thumb|Bosworth Battlefield true location]]\n\n===Historians' theories===\n\nThe [[Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England]] (popularly referred to as \"English Heritage\") argues that the battle was named after Market Bosworth because the town was the nearest significant settlement to the battlefield in the 15th century.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=4}} As explored by Professor Philip Morgan, a battle might initially not be named specifically at all. As time passes, writers of administrative and historical records find it necessary to identify a notable battle, ascribing it a name that is usually [[toponymy|toponymical]] in nature and sourced from combatants or observers. This official name becomes accepted by society and future generations without question.{{sfn|Morgan|2000|p=42}}  Early records associated the Battle of Bosworth with \"Brownehethe\", \"''bellum Miravallenses''\", \"Sandeford\" and \"Dadlyngton field\".{{sfn|Morgan|2000|p=44}}  The earliest record, a municipal memorandum of 23 August 1485 from York,{{sfn|Foard|2004|p=17}} locates the battle \"on the field of Redemore\".{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|pp=1–2}}  This is corroborated by a 1485–86 letter that mentions \"Redesmore\" as its site.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=2}}  According to historian Peter Foss, records did not associate the battle with \"Bosworth\" until 1510.{{sfn|Morgan|2000|p=44}}\n\nFoss is named by English Heritage as the principal advocate for \"Redemore\" as the battle site. He suggests the name is derived from \"''Hreod Mor''\", an Anglo-Saxon phrase that means \"reedy marshland\". Basing his opinion on 13th- and 16th-century church records, he believes \"Redemore\" was an area of wetland that lay between Ambion Hill and the village of [[Dadlington]], and was close to the Fenn Lanes, a [[Roman roads|Roman road]] running east to west across the region.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=2}}  Foard believes this road to be the most probable route that both armies took to reach the battlefield.{{sfn|Foard|2004|p=51}}  Williams dismisses the notion of \"Redmore\" as a specific location, saying that the term refers to a large area of reddish soil; Foss argues that Williams's sources are local stories and flawed interpretations of records.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=3}}  Moreover, he proposes that Williams was influenced by [[William Hutton (Birmingham historian)|William Hutton]]'s 1788 ''The Battle of Bosworth-Field'', which Foss blames for introducing the notion that the battle was fought west of Ambion Hill on the north side of the [[River Sence]].{{sfn|Foss|1998|p=22}}  Hutton, as Foss suggests, misinterpreted a passage from his source, [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s 1577 ''Chronicle''. Holinshed wrote, \"King Richard pitched his field on a hill called Anne Beame, refreshed his soldiers and took his rest.\"  Foss believes that Hutton mistook \"field\" to mean \"field of battle\", thus creating the idea that the fight took place on Anne Beame (Ambion) Hill. To \"[pitch] his field\", as Foss clarifies, was a period expression for setting up a camp.{{sfn|Foss|1998|p=21}}\n\n[[File:St James the Greater, Dadlington.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Side view of a building, which has a small tower on the left side: tombstones lie in rows on plots in front.|St James the Greater, Dadlington: the dead of Bosworth Field were buried here.]]\nFoss brings further evidence for his \"Redemore\" theory by quoting [[Edward Hall]]'s 1550 ''Chronicle''. Hall stated that Richard's army stepped onto a plain after breaking camp the next day. Furthermore, historian [[William Burton (antiquary)|William Burton]], author of ''Description of Leicestershire'' (1622),{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=2}} wrote that the battle was \"fought in a large, flat, plaine, and spacious ground, three&nbsp;miles [5&nbsp;km] distant from [Bosworth], between the Towne of [[Shenton]], Sutton [Cheney], Dadlington and Stoke [Golding]\".{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=3}}  In Foss's opinion both sources are describing an area of flat ground north of Dadlington.{{sfn|Foss|1998|p=28}}\n\n===Physical site===\nEnglish Heritage, responsible for managing England's historic sites, used both theories to designate the site for Bosworth Field. Without preference for either theory, they constructed a single continuous battlefield boundary that encompasses the locations proposed by both Williams and Foss.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|pp=12–13}}  The region has experienced extensive changes over the years, starting after the battle. Holinshed stated in his chronicle that he found firm ground where he expected the marsh to be, and Burton confirmed that by the end of the 16th century, areas of the battlefield were enclosed and had been [[Land improvement|improved]] to make them agriculturally productive. Trees were planted on the south side of Ambion Hill, forming Ambion Wood. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the [[Ashby Canal]] carved through the land west and south-west of Ambion Hill. Winding alongside the canal at a distance, the [[Ashby and Nuneaton Joint Railway]] crossed the area on an embankment.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=4}}{{sfn|Gravett|1999|p=83}}  The changes to the landscape were so extensive that when Hutton revisited the region in 1807 after an earlier 1788 visit, he could not readily find his way around.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=4}}\n\n[[File:King Richard's Well.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A pyramidal stone structure stands in a small clearing surrounded by small trees and bushes.

The new site lies either side of the Fenn Lanes Roman road, close to Fenn Lane Farm and is some three kilometers to the southwest of Ambion Hill. [[File:Bosworth Battlefield (Fenn Lane Farm).jpg|thumb|Bosworth Battlefield (Fenn Lane Farm)]] \nBased on the round shot scatter, the likely size of Richard III's army, and the topography, Glenn Foard and Anne Curry think that Richard may have lined up his forces on a slight ridge which lies just east of Fox Covert Lane and behind a postulated medieval marsh.<ref>http://www.battlefieldstrust.com/media/776.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.battlefieldstrust.com/media/775.pdf</ref>  Richard's vanguard commanded by the Duke of Norfolk was on the right (north) side of Richard's battle line, with the Earl of Northumberland on Richard's left (south) side.\n\nTudor's forces approached along the line of the Roman road and lined up to the west of the present day Fenn Lane Farm, having marched from the vicinity of Merevale in Warwickshire.<ref>Peter Hammond, ''Richard III and the Bosworth Campaign'', (Barnsley, Pen and Sword, 2013) p.64</ref> \nThe Stanleys were positioned on the south side of the battlefield, on rising ground towards Stoke Golding and Dadlington. The Earl of Oxford turned north to avoid the marsh (and possibly Richard's guns). This manoeuvre put the marsh on Oxford's right. He moved to attack Norfolk's vanguard. Norfolk was subsequently killed.\n\nNorthumberland failed to engage, possibly due to the presence of the Stanleys, whose intentions were unclear, or due to the position of the marsh (or for both reasons). With his situation deteriorating, Richard decided to launch an attack against Henry Tudor, which almost succeeded, but the king's horse became stuck in the marsh, and he was killed. Fen Hole (where the boar badge was found) is believed to be a residue of the marsh. When Richard began his charge, Sir William Stanley intervened from the vicinity of Stoke Golding. It was here, on what came to be known as Crown Hill (the closest elevated ground to the fighting), that Lord Stanley crowned Henry Tudor after Richard was killed.[[File:Bosworth Battlefield actual site.jpg|thumb|Bosworth Battlefield actual site]]\n\nThe windmill close to which the Duke of Norfolk is said to have died (according to the ballad \"Lady Bessy\") was Dadlington windmill. This has disappeared but is known to have stood at the time of the battle, in the vicinity of Apple Orchard Farm and North Farm, Dadlington. A small cluster of significant finds was made in this area, including a gold livery badge depicting an eagle. The windmill lay between the core battlefield and Richard's camp on Ambion Hill and the rout of Norfolk's vanguard was in this direction. This also accounts for the large number of dead in Dadlington parish, leading to the setting up of the battle chantry there.\n\nHistoric England have re-defined the boundaries of the registered Bosworth Battlefield to incorporate the newly identified site.

On 9 August 48 BC at [[Pharsalus]] in central Greece, [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]] and his allies formed up opposite the army of the [[Roman Republic|republic]] under the command of [[Pompey|Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] (\"Pompey the Great\"). Pompey had the backing of a majority of the [[Roman Senate|senators]], of whom many were [[optimate]]s, and his army significantly outnumbered the veteran Caesarian legions.\n\nThe two armies confronted each other over several months of uncertainty, Caesar being in a much weaker position than Pompey.\nThe former found himself isolated in a hostile country with only 22,000 men and short of provisions, while on the other side of the river he was faced by Pompey with an army about twice as large in number. Pompey wanted to delay, knowing the enemy would eventually surrender from hunger and exhaustion. Pressured by the senators present and by his officers, he reluctantly engaged in battle and suffered an overwhelming defeat, ultimately fleeing the camp and his men, disguised as an ordinary citizen.\n\n==Prelude==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}\nA dispute between Caesar and the ''optimates'' faction in the Senate of Rome culminated in Caesar marching his army on Rome and forcing Pompey, accompanied by much of the [[Roman Senate]], to flee in 49 BC from Italy to Greece, where he could better conscript an army to face his former ally. Caesar, lacking a fleet to immediately give chase, solidified his control over the western Mediterranean – Spain specifically – before assembling ships to follow Pompey. [[Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus]], whom Pompey had appointed to command his 600-ship fleet, set up a massive blockade to prevent Caesar from crossing to Greece and to prevent any aid to Italy. Caesar, defying convention, chose to cross the Adriatic during the winter, with only half his fleet at a time. This move surprised Bibulus, and the first wave of ships managed to run the blockade easily. Now prepared, Bibulus managed to prevent any further ships from crossing, but died soon afterwards.\n\nCaesar was now in a precarious position, holding a beachhead at [[Epirus]] with only half his army, no ability to supply his troops by sea, and limited local support, as the Greek cities were mostly loyal to Pompey. Caesar's only choice was to fortify his position, forage what supplies he could, and wait on his remaining army to attempt another crossing. Pompey by now had a massive international army; however, his troops were mostly untested raw recruits, while Caesar's troops were hardened veterans. Realizing Caesar's difficulty in keeping his troops supplied, Pompey decided to simply mirror Caesar's forces and let hunger do the fighting for him. Caesar began to despair and used every channel he could think of to pursue peace with Pompey. When this was rebuffed he made an attempt to cross back to Italy to collect his missing troops, but was turned back by a storm. Finally, [[Mark Antony]] rallied the remaining forces in Italy, fought through the blockade and made the crossing, reinforcing Caesar's forces in both men and spirit. Now at full strength, Caesar felt confident to take the fight to Pompey.\n\nPompey was camped in a strong position just south of [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (48 BC)|Dyrrhachium]] with the sea to his back and surrounded by hills, making a direct assault impossible. Caesar ordered a wall to be built around Pompey's position in order to cut off water and pasture land for his horses. Pompey built a parallel wall and in between a kind of no man's land was created, with fighting comparable to the trench warfare of [[World War&nbsp;I]]. Ultimately the standoff was broken when a traitor in Caesar's army informed Pompey of a weakness in Caesar's wall. Pompey immediately exploited this information and forced Caesar's army into a full retreat, but ordered his army not to pursue, fearing Caesar's reputation for setting elaborate traps. This caused Caesar to remark, \"Today the victory had been the enemy's, had there been any one among them to gain it.\"<ref>[[Plutarch]] ''Pompey'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0058%3Achapter%3D65%3Asection%3D5 65.5], Dryden translation: [https://books.google.com/books?id=QScSAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA465&lpg=PA465 p. 465].</ref>  Pompey continued his strategy of mirroring Caesar's forces and avoiding any direct engagements.  After trapping Caesar in [[Thessaly]], the prominent senators in Pompey's camp began to argue loudly for a more decisive victory. Although Pompey was strongly against it — he wanted to surround and starve Caesar's army instead — he eventually gave in and accepted battle from Caesar on a field near Pharsalus.\n\n==Date and location==\nThe date of the actual decisive battle is given as 9 August 48 BC according to the republican calendar.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} According to the Julian calendar however, the date was either 29 June (according to Le Verrier's chronological reconstruction) or possibly 7 June (according to Drumann/Groebe).{{where?|date=July 2014}}{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} As Pompey was assassinated on 3 September 48 BC, the battle must have taken place in the true month of August, when the harvest was becoming ripe (or Pompey's strategy of starving Caesar would not be plausible).{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nThe location of the battlefield was for a long time the subject of controversy among scholars. Caesar himself, in his [[Commentarii de Bello Civili]], mentions few place-names;<ref>''Bellum Civile'' 3.81–98</ref> and although the battle is called after Pharsalos, four ancient writers – the author of the ''Bellum Alexandrinum'' (48.1), [[Frontinus]] (''Strategemata'' 2.3.22), [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] (20), and [[Orosius]] (6.15.27) – place it specifically at ''Palae''pharsalos. [[Strabo]] in his ''Geographica'' (''Γεωγραφικά'') mentions both old and new Pharsaloi, and notes that the Thetideion, the temple to [[Thetis]] south of Scotoussa, was near both. In 198 BC, in the [[Second Macedonian War]], [[Philip V of Macedon]] sacked Palaepharsalos ([[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'' 32.13.9), but left new Pharsalos untouched. These two details perhaps imply that the two cities were not close neighbours. Until the early 20th century, unsure of the site of Palaepharsalos, scholars followed [[Appian]] (2.75) and located the battle of 48 BC south of the Enipeus or close to Pharsalos (today's [[Pharsala]]).<ref>Map with conjectured locations, ''Annual of the British School at Athens'', No. XXIV, 1921 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/30102514?seq=21]</ref>\n\nThe “north-bank” thesis of [[F.

Some only had about a thousand men at the time of Pharsalus, due partly to losses at Dyrrhachium and partly to Caesar's wish to rapidly advance with a picked body as opposed to a ponderous movement with a large army.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://militaryhistory.about.com/od/battleswarsto1000/p/pharsalus.htm|title=Battle of Pharsalus |publisher=militaryhistory.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-18}}</ref> According to his accounts, he had 80 [[cohort (military unit)|cohorts]] on the battlefield, about 22,000 men.<ref>Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Civili,III 89,2</ref>\n\n===Pompeian army===\n\nIn total, Caesar counted 110 complete cohorts in the Pompeian army, 11 legions consisting of about 45,000 men, although [[Orosius]], following [[Livy]] and Pollio, only counted 88 cohorts,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} and Hans Delbrück suggests that Caesar's count includes detachments at Dyrrachium and elsewhere, leaving only 88 cohorts in the Pompeian army.<ref>Hans Delbrück, ''Warfare in Antiquity'', p. 545.</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n\n===Deployment===\n[[File:The Battle of Pharsalus - initial dispositions.png|thumb|Initial deployment of forces at the Battle of Pharsalus, August 48 BC]]\n\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}\nOn the Pharsalian plain, Pompey deployed his infantry in the traditional three lines of 10 men deep,thusly: Legions I and III were on the left with Pompey himself; at his center were the legions from Syria commanded by [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio Nasica|Scipio]], and on the right, against the Enipeus River, were legions from Cilicia and Spanish auxiliaries. Pompey's cavalry, which greatly outnumbered Caesar's, were commanded by [[Titus Labienus|Labienus]], a brilliant cavalry commander and Caesar's old lieutenant during the [[Gallic Wars]]. They were massed in a single body on Pompey's left flank, together with his auxiliary archers and slingers. Pompey's tactical plan was to allow Caesar's legions to charge while his own stood their ground, reasoning that the enemy would fatigue by charging the double distance, and that his own men would better withstand the [[pilum]] toss while stationary. Simultaneously his cavalry would overwhelm the enemy's and then take the legions in the flank and rear — a classic [[hammer and anvil]] tactic.\n\nCaesar also deployed his men in three lines, but, being outnumbered, had to thin his ranks to a depth of only six men, in order to match the frontage presented by Pompey. His left flank, resting on the Enipeus River, consisted of his [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (48 BC)|battle worn]] IX<sup>th</sup> legion supplemented by the VIII<sup>th</sup> legion, these commanded by [[Mark Antony]]. The center was commanded by [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 32 BC)|Domitius]] and upon his right he placed his favored X<sup>th</sup> legion, giving [[Publius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]] command of this flank — Caesar himself took his stand on the right, across from Pompey. Upon seeing the disposition of Pompey's army Caesar grew discomforted, and further thinned his third line in order to form a fourth line on his right: this to counter the onslaught of the enemy cavalry, which he knew his numerically inferior cavalry could not withstand. This new line he gave detailed instructions for the role they would play, hinting that upon them would rest the fortunes of the day, and gave strict orders to his third line not to charge until specifically ordered.\n\n=== Progress of the battle ===\n{{refimprove section|date=July 2014}}\nThere was significant distance between the two armies, according to Caesar.<ref>Caesar, BC III 92,1.</ref> Pompey ordered his men not to charge, but to wait until Caesar's legions came into close quarters; Pompey's adviser [[Caius Triarius]] believed that Caesar's infantry would be fatigued and fall into disorder if they were forced to cover twice the expected distance of a battle march. Also stationary troops were expected to be able to defend better against [[Pilum|pila]] throws.<ref>Caesar, BC III, 92,2.</ref> Seeing that Pompey's army was not advancing, Caesar's infantry under [[Mark Antony]] and [[Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus]] started the advance. As Caesar's men reached near throwing distance, without orders, they stopped to rest and regroup before continuing the charge;<ref>Caesar, BC III, 93,1.</ref> Pompey's right and centre line held as the two armies collided.\n\nAs Pompey's infantry fought, [[Labienus]] ordered the Pompeian cavalry on his left flank to attack Caesar's cavalry; as expected they successfully pushed back Caesar's cavalry. Caesar then revealed his hidden fourth line of infantry and surprised Pompey's cavalry charge; Caesar's men were ordered to leap up and use their [[Pilum|pila]] to thrust at Pompey's cavalry instead of throwing them. Pompey's cavalry panicked and suffered hundreds of casualties. After failing to reform, the rest of the cavalry retreated to the hills, leaving the left wing of Pompey's legions exposed. Caesar then ordered in his third line, containing his most battle-hardened veterans. These broke Pompey's left wing troops, who fled the battlefield.<ref>https://www.academia.edu/19860273/48_BC_The_Battle_of_Pharsalus</ref>\n\nAfter routing Pompey's cavalry, Caesar threw in his last line of reserves<ref>Caesar, BC III, 93,4</ref> —a move which at this point meant that the battle was more or less decided.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Pompey lost the will to fight as he watched both cavalry and legions under his command break formation and flee from battle, and he retreated to his camp, leaving the rest of his troops at the centre and right flank to their own devices. He ordered the garrisoned auxiliaries to defend camp as he gathered his family, loaded up gold, and threw off his general's cloak to make a quick escape.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} As the rest of Pompey's army were left confused, Caesar urged his men to end the day by routing the rest of Pompey's troops and capturing the Pompeian camp.  They complied with his wishes; after finishing off the remains of Pompey's men, they furiously attacked the camp walls. The Thracians and the other auxiliaries who were left in the Pompeian camp, in total seven cohorts, defended bravely, but were not able to fend off the assault.<ref>https://www.academia.edu/19860273/48_BC_The_Battle_of_Pharsalus</ref>\n\nCaesar had won his greatest victory, claiming to have only lost about 200 soldiers and 30 centurions.<ref>Caesar, BC III 99,1.</ref> In his history of the war, Caesar would praise his own men's discipline and experience, and remembered each of his [[centurion]]s by name. He also questioned Pompey's decision not to charge.<ref>Caesar, BC III, 92,3.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}\nPompey fled from Pharsalus to [[Egypt]], where he was assassinated on the order of [[Ptolemy XIII]]. Ptolemy XIII sent Pompey's head to Caesar in an effort to win his favor, but instead secured him as a furious enemy.  Ptolemy, advised by his regent, the eunuch [[Pothinus]], and his rhetoric tutor [[Theodotus of Chios]], had failed to take into account that Caesar was granting amnesty to a great number of those of the [[Optimates|senatorial]] faction in their defeat. Even men who had been bitter enemies were allowed not only to return to Rome but to assume their previous positions in Roman society.\n\nPompey's assassination had deprived Caesar of his ultimate public relations moment — pardoning his most ardent rival. The Battle of Pharsalus ended the wars of the [[First Triumvirate]]. The Roman Civil War, however, was not ended. Pompey's two sons, [[Gnaeus Pompeius (son of Pompey the Great)|Gnaeus Pompeius]] and [[Sextus Pompey]], and the Pompeian faction, led now by Metellus Scipio and Cato, survived and fought for their cause in the name of Pompey the Great. Caesar spent the next few years 'mopping up' remnants of the [[Optimates|senatorial faction]].  After seemingly vanquishing all his enemies and bringing peace to Rome, he was assassinated in 44 BC by friends, in a conspiracy organized by [[Marcus Junius Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]].\n\n==Importance==\n[[Paul K. Davis (historian)|Paul K. Davis]] wrote that \"Caesar's victory took him to the pinnacle of power, effectively ending the Republic.\"<ref>Paul K. Davis, ''100 Decisive Battles from Ancient Times to the Present: The World’s Major Battles and How They Shaped History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), 59.</ref> The battle itself did not end the civil war but it was decisive and gave Caesar a much needed boost in legitimacy. Until then much of the Roman world outside Italy supported Pompey and his allies due to the extensive list of clients he held in all corners of the Republic.  After Pompey's defeat former allies began to align themselves with Caesar as some came to believe the gods favored him, while for others it was simple self-preservation.  The ancients took great stock in success as a sign of favoritism by the gods.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}  This is especially true of success in the face of almost certain defeat — as Caesar experienced at Pharsalus.  This allowed Caesar to parlay this single victory into a huge network of willing clients to better secure his hold over power and force the Optimates into near exile in search for allies to continue the fight against Caesar.\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe battle gives its name to the following artistic, geographical, and business concerns:\n\n* ''[[Pharsalia]]'', a poem by [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]]\n* [[Pharsalia, New York]], U.S.\n* [[Pharsalia Technologies]], Inc.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [http://www.livius.org/pha-phd/pharsalus/battle.html Caesar's account of the battle]\n* [http://www.jstor.org/stable/30102514?seq=1 Frank Laurence Lucas, 'The Battlefield of Pharsalos', ''Annual of the British School at Athens'', No. XXIV, 1919–21]\n* [http://www.jstor.org/stable/4434412 Michel Rambaud, 'Le Soleil de Pharsale', ''Historia: Zeitschrift für Alte Geschichte '', Vol.3, No.4, 1955]\n* [http://www.jstor.org/stable/283876 William E.

The dangers to Vienna were considerable: the [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria|Elector of Bavaria]] and [[Ferdinand de Marsin|Marshal Marsin]]'s forces in [[Bavaria]] threatened from the west, and [[Louis Joseph de Bourbon, duc de Vendôme|Marshal Vendôme]]'s large army in northern Italy posed a serious danger with a potential offensive through the [[Brenner Pass]]. Vienna was also under pressure from [[Francis II Rákóczi|Rákóczi]]'s [[Rákóczi's War for Independence|Hungarian revolt]] from its eastern approaches. Realising the danger, the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] resolved to alleviate the peril to Vienna by marching his forces south from [[Bedburg]] and help maintain Emperor Leopold within the Grand Alliance.\n\nA combination of deception and skilled administration – designed to conceal his true destination from friend and foe alike – enabled Marlborough to march {{convert|250|mi|km|abbr=off}} unhindered from the [[Low Countries]] to the [[River Danube]] in five weeks. [[Battle of Schellenberg|After securing Donauwörth on the Danube]], Marlborough sought to engage the Elector's and Marsin's army before [[Camille d'Hostun, duc de Tallard|Marshal Tallard]] could bring reinforcements through the [[Black Forest]]. However, with the Franco-Bavarian commanders reluctant to fight until their numbers were deemed sufficient, the Duke enacted a policy of [[Looting|plundering]] in Bavaria designed to force the issue. The tactic proved unsuccessful, but when Tallard arrived to bolster the Elector's army, and [[Prince Eugene of Savoy|Prince Eugene]] arrived with reinforcements for the Allies, the two armies finally met on the banks of the Danube in and around the small village of [[Blindheim]], from which the English \"Blenheim\" is derived.\n\nThe battle has gone down in history as one of the turning points of the War of the Spanish Succession. Bavaria was knocked out of the war, and Louis' hopes for a quick victory came to an end. France suffered over 38,000 casualties including the commander-in-chief, Marshal Tallard, who was taken captive to England. Before the 1704 campaign ended, the Allies had taken [[Landau]], and the towns of [[Trier]] and [[Traben-Trarbach|Trarbach]] on the [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]] in preparation for the following year's campaign into France itself.\n\n==Background==\nBy 1704, the War of the Spanish Succession was in its fourth year. The previous year had been one of success for France and her allies, most particularly on the [[Danube]], where [[Claude-Louis-Hector de Villars|Marshal Villars]] and the Elector of Bavaria had created a direct threat to Vienna, the Habsburg capital.<ref name=chandler124>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 124</ref> Vienna had been saved by dissension between the two commanders, leading to the brilliant Villars being replaced by the less dynamic Marshal Marsin. Nevertheless, by 1704, the threat was still real: [[Francis II Rákóczi|Rákóczi]]'s Hungarian revolt was already threatening the Empire's eastern approaches, and Marshal Vendôme's forces threatened an invasion from northern Italy.<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667–1714'', p. 285</ref> In the courts of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] and [[Madrid]], Vienna's fall was confidently anticipated, an event which would almost certainly have led to the collapse of the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]].<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 125</ref>\n\nTo isolate the Danube from any Allied intervention, [[François de Neufville, duc de Villeroi|Marshal Villeroi]]'s 46,000 troops were expected to pin the 70,000 Dutch and English troops around [[Maastricht]] in the Low Countries, while General [[Robert Jean Antoine de Franquetot de Coigny|de Coigny]] protected [[Alsace]] against surprise with a further corps.<ref name=chandler124/> The only forces immediately available for Vienna's defence were [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Prince Louis of Baden's]] force of 36,000 stationed in the [[Lines of Stollhofen]]<ref>The Lines of Stollhofen are a military chain of posts designed for the defence of the Rhine Valley. The lines ranged {{convert|20|mi|km}} between Stollhofen, a small village on the Rhine, to the Black Forest. The barrier was designed to stop the French marching down the Rhine from Strasbourg.</ref> to watch Marshal Tallard at Strasbourg; there was also a weak force of 10,000 men under [[Hermann Otto II of Limburg Stirum|Field Marshal Count Limburg Styrum]] observing [[Ulm]].\n\nBoth the Imperial Austrian Ambassador in London, [[John Wenceslau Wratislaw von Mitrowitz|Count Wratislaw]], and the Duke of Marlborough realised the implications of the situation on the Danube. The Dutch, however, who clung to their troops for their country's protection, were against any adventurous military operation as far south as the Danube and would never willingly permit any major weakening of the forces in the [[Spanish Netherlands]].<ref name=chandler127>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 127</ref> Marlborough, realising the only way to ignore Dutch wishes was by the use of secrecy and guile, set out to deceive his Dutch allies by pretending to simply move his troops to the [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]] – a plan approved of by [[The Hague]] – but once there, he would slip the Dutch leash and link up with Austrian forces in southern Germany.<ref name=chandler127/> \"My intentions\", wrote the Duke from The Hague on 29 April to his governmental confidant, [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Sidney Godolphin]], \"are to march with the English to [[Koblenz|Coblenz]] and declare that I intend to campaign on the Moselle. But when I come there, to write to the Dutch States that I think it absolutely necessary for the saving of the Empire to march with the troops under my command and to join with those that are in Germany ... in order to make measures with Prince Lewis of Baden for the speedy reduction of the Elector of Bavaria.\"<ref name=Falkner1>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 18</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Protagonists march to the Danube===\n:''A scarlet caterpillar, upon which all eyes were at once fixed, began to crawl steadfastly day by day across the map of Europe, dragging the whole war with it.'' – [[Winston Churchill]].<ref>Spencer: ''Blenheim: Battle for Europe'', p. 136</ref>\n\n[[Image:March to the Danube 1704.png|thumb|300px|The [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]]'s march from [[Bedburg]] (near [[Cologne]]) to the [[Danube]]. His 250-mile (400-kilometre) march to prevent [[Vienna]] falling into enemy hands was a masterpiece of deception, meticulous planning and organisation.]]\n\nMarlborough's march started on 19 May from Bedburg, {{convert|20|mi|km}} north-west of Cologne. The army (assembled by the Duke's brother, General [[Charles Churchill (British Army general)|Charles Churchill]]) consisted of 66 [[Squadron (cavalry)|squadrons]], 31 [[battalions]] and 38 guns and mortars totalling 21,000 men (16,000 of whom were [[Kingdom of England|English]] troops).<ref name=chandler128>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 128. The initial force of 21,000 men were accompanied by 1,700 supply carts drawn by 5,000 draught horses. The artillery needed as many more.</ref> This force was to be augmented ''en route'' such that by the time Marlborough reached the Danube, it would number 40,000 (47 battalions, 88 squadrons). Whilst Marlborough led his army, [[Henry de Nassau, Lord Overkirk|General Overkirk]] would maintain a defensive position in the [[Dutch Republic]] in case Villeroi mounted an attack. The Duke had assured the Dutch that if the French were to launch an offensive he would return in good time, but Marlborough calculated that as he marched south, the French commander would be drawn after him.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 19</ref> In this assumption Marlborough proved correct: Villeroi shadowed the Duke with 30,000 men in 60 squadrons and 42 battalions.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 129. Barnett and Coxe states 45 squadrons and 36 battalions.</ref>\n\nThe military dangers in such an enterprise were numerous: Marlborough's lines of communication along the Rhine would be hopelessly exposed to French interference, for Louis' generals controlled the left bank of the river and its central reaches. Such a long march would almost certainly involve a high wastage of men and horses through exhaustion and disease. However, Marlborough was convinced of the urgency – \"I am very sensible that I take a great deal upon me\", he had earlier written to Godolphin, \"but should I act otherwise, the Empire would be undone ...\"\n[[File:John Churchill Marlborough porträtterad av Adriaen van der Werff (1659-1722).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of the Duke of Marlborough by [[Adriaen van der Werff]] (December 1704) [[Uffizi]]]]\n\nWhilst Allied preparations had progressed, the French were striving to maintain and re-supply Marshal Marsin. Marsin had been operating with the Elector of Bavaria against the Imperial commander, Prince Louis of Baden, and was somewhat isolated from France: his only lines of communication lay through the rocky passes of the Black Forest. However, on 14 May, with considerable skill Marshal Tallard managed to bring 10,000 reinforcements and vast supplies and munitions through the difficult terrain, whilst outmanoeuvring Baron Thüngen, the Imperial general who sought to block his path.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 20. Falkner gives a total of 8,000</ref> Tallard then returned with his own force to the Rhine, once again side-stepping Thüngen's efforts to intercept him. The whole operation was an outstanding military achievement.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 20, although Chandler p. 131 states that many men were lost on the return journey through desertion.</ref>\n\nOn 26 May, Marlborough reached Coblenz, where the Moselle meets the Rhine. If he intended an attack along the Moselle the Duke must now turn west, but, instead, the following day the army crossed to the right bank of the Rhine, (pausing to add 5,000 waiting [[Hanoverians]] and [[Prussia]]ns).<ref>Tincey: ''Blenheim 1704: The Duke of Marlborough's Masterpiece'', p. 31</ref> \"There will be no campaign on the Moselle\", wrote Villeroi who had taken up a defensive position on the river, \"the English have all gone up into Germany.\"<ref name=falkner22>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 22</ref> A second possible objective now occurred to the French – an Allied incursion into Alsace and an attack on the city of [[Strasbourg]]. Marlborough skillfully encouraged this apprehension by constructing bridges across the Rhine at [[Philippsburg]], a ruse that not only encouraged Villeroi to come to Tallard's aid in the defence of Alsace, but one that ensured the French plan to march on Vienna remained paralysed by uncertainty.<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p. 89</ref>\n\nWith Villeroi shadowing Marlborough's every move, Marlborough's gamble that the French would not move against the weakened Dutch position in the Netherlands paid off.<ref name=chandler129>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 129</ref> In any case, Marlborough had promised to return to the Netherlands if a French attack developed there, transferring his troops down the Rhine on barges at a rate of {{convert|80|mi|km|abbr=off}} a day.<ref name=chandler129/> Encouraged by this promise (whatever it was worth) the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] agreed to release the Danish contingent of seven battalions and 22 squadrons as a reinforcement.<ref name=chandler129/> Marlborough reached [[Ladenburg]], in the plain of the Neckar and the Rhine, and there halted for three days to rest his cavalry and allow the guns and infantry to close up.<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p. 91</ref> On 6 June he arrived at [[Wiesloch]], south of [[Heidelberg]]. The following day, the Allied army swung away from the Rhine towards the hills of the [[Swabian Jura]] and the Danube beyond. At last Marlborough's destination was established without doubt.\n\n===Strategy===\n[[Image:Prinz Eugene of Savoy.PNG|thumb|180px|[[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] (1663–1736) by [[Jacob van Schuppen]].

It was the start of a lifelong personal and professional friendship.]]\n\nOn 10 June, the Duke met for the first time the President of the [[Imperial War Council]], Prince Eugene – accompanied by Count Wratislaw – at the village of [[Mundelsheim]], halfway between the Danube and the Rhine.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 23</ref> By 13 June, the Imperial Field Commander, Prince Louis of Baden, had joined them in [[Weinstadt|Großheppach]].<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 25. Eugene had doubts about Baden's reliability, for he was a close friend of the Elector of Bavaria. It was even suspected that Baden was secretly corresponding with his old comrade.</ref> The three generals commanded a force of nearly 110,000 men. At conference it was decided that Eugene would return with 28,000 men to the Lines of Stollhofen on the Rhine to keep an eye on Villeroi and Tallard and prevent them going to the aid of the Franco-Bavarian army on the Danube. Meanwhile, Marlborough's and Baden's forces would combine, totalling 80,000 men, for the march on the Danube to seek out the Elector and Marsin before they could be reinforced.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 132</ref>\n\nKnowing Marlborough's destination, Tallard and Villeroi met at [[Landau]] in the Palatinate on 13 June to rapidly construct a plan to save Bavaria but the rigidity of the French command system was such that any variations from the original plan had to be sanctioned by [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]].<ref name=Chandler1>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 133</ref> The [[Jean-Philippe-Eugène de Mérode-Westerloo|Count of Mérode-Westerloo]], commander of the [[Flemish people|Flemish]] troops in Tallard's army wrote – \"One thing is certain: we delayed our march from Alsace for far too long and quite inexplicably.\"<ref name=Chandler1 /> Approval from [[King Louis XIV|Louis]] arrived on 27 June: Tallard was to reinforce Marsin and the Elector on the Danube via the Black Forest, with 40 battalions and 50 squadrons; Villeroi was to pin down the Allies defending the Lines of Stollhofen, or, if the Allies should move all their forces to the Danube, he was to join with Marshal Tallard; and General de Coignies with 8,000 men, would protect Alsace. On 1 July Tallard's army of 35,000 re-crossed the Rhine at [[Kehl]] and began its march.<ref name=Chandler1 />\n\nOn 22 June, Marlborough's forces linked up with Baden's Imperial forces at Launsheim. A distance of {{convert|250|mi|km|abbr=off}} had been covered in five weeks.<ref>Lynn p. 287. Lynn states that the march-rate was not unprecedented for the period, averaging {{convert|7.5|mi|km|abbr=off}} per day. What stands out was the distance and the fine condition of the troops when they arrived.</ref> Thanks to a carefully planned time-table, the effects of wear and tear had been kept to a minimum. Captain Parker described the march discipline – \"As we marched through the country of our Allies, commissars were appointed to furnish us with all manner of necessaries for man and horse ... the soldiers had nothing to do but pitch their tents, boil kettles and lie down to rest.\"<ref name=chandler131>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 131. The Allied march had not been without loss: French spies reported that 900 sick had been left at [[Kassel]].</ref> In response to Marlborough's manoeuvres, the Elector and Marsin, conscious of their numerical disadvantage with only 40,000 men, moved their forces to the entrenched camp at [[Dillingen an der Donau|Dillingen]] on the north bank of the Danube. Marlborough could not attack Dillingen because of a lack of siege guns – he was unable to bring any from the Low Countries, and Baden had failed to supply any despite assurances to the contrary.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 26</ref>\n\n[[Image:Marlborough's assault on Schellenberg, 2 July 1704.gif|thumb|left|250px|Allied assault on the Schellenberg – taken by [[coup de main]] on 2 July – provided the Allies with an excellent river crossing.]]\nThe Allies, nevertheless, needed a base for provisions and a good river crossing. On 2 July, therefore, Marlborough at the [[Battle of Schellenberg]] stormed the fortress of Schellenberg on the heights above the town of [[Donauwörth]]. [[Jean Baptist, Comte d'Arco|Count Jean d'Arco]] had been sent with 12,000 men from the Franco-Bavarian camp to hold the town and grassy hill but after a ferocious and bloody battle, inflicting enormous casualties on both sides, Schellenberg finally succumbed, forcing Donauwörth to surrender shortly afterwards. The Elector, knowing his position at Dillingen was now not tenable, took up a position behind the strong fortifications of [[Augsburg]].<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 40</ref>\n\nTallard's march presented a dilemma for Eugene. If the Allies were not to be outnumbered on the Danube, Eugene realised he must either try to cut Tallard off before he could get there or he must hasten to reinforce Marlborough.<ref name=henderson103>Henderson: ''Prince Eugen of Savoy'', p. 103</ref> if he withdrew from the Rhine to the Danube, Villeroi might also make a move south to link up with the Elector and Marsin. Eugene compromised: leaving 12,000 troops behind guarding the Lines of Stollhofen, he marched off with the rest of his army to forestall Tallard.<ref name=henderson103/>\n\nLacking in numbers, Eugene could not seriously disrupt Tallard's march but the French Marshal's progress was proving pitifully slow. Tallard's force had suffered considerably more than Marlborough's troops on their march – many of his cavalry horses were suffering from [[glanders]] and the mountain passes were proving tough for the 2,000 wagons of provisions. Local German peasants, angry at French plundering, compounded Tallard's problems, leading Mérode-Westerloo to bemoan – \"the enraged peasantry killed several thousand of our men before the army was clear of the Black Forest.\"<ref name=chandler131/> Tallard had insisted on besieging the little town of [[Villingen]] for six days (16–22 July) but abandoned the enterprise on discovering the approach of Eugene.\n\nThe Elector in Augsburg was informed on 14 July that Tallard was on his way through the Black Forest. This good news bolstered the Elector's policy of inaction, further encouraging him to wait for the reinforcements.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 139</ref> But this reticence to fight induced Marlborough to undertake a controversial policy of spoliation in Bavaria, burning buildings and crops throughout the rich lands south of the Danube. This had two aims: firstly to put pressure on the Elector to fight or come to terms before Tallard arrived with reinforcements; and secondly, to ruin Bavaria as a base from which the French and Bavarian armies could attack Vienna, or pursue the Duke into [[Franconia]] if, at some stage, he had to withdraw northwards.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 41</ref> But this destruction, coupled with a protracted siege of [[Rain (Lech)|Rain]] (9–16 July), caused Prince Eugene to lament \"...&nbsp;since the Donauwörth action I cannot admire their performances\", and later to conclude \"If he has to go home without having achieved his objective, he will certainly be ruined.\"<ref>Spencer: ''Blenheim: Battle for Europe'', p. 215</ref> Nevertheless, strategically the Duke had been able to place his numerically stronger forces between the Franco-Bavarian army and Vienna.\n\n===Final positioning===\n[[Image:Maneuvers before the Battle of Blenheim, 6-13 August 1704.gif|thumb|250px|[[Maneuver warfare|Manoeuvres]] before the battle 9–13 August.]]\n\nMarshal Tallard, with 34,000 men, reached Ulm, joining with the Elector and Marsin in Augsburg on 5 August (although Tallard was not impressed to find that the Elector had dispersed his army in response to Marlborough's campaign of ravaging the region).<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 44. Lynn states Tallard reached Augsburg on 3 August.</ref> Also on 5 August, Eugene reached [[Höchstädt an der Donau|Höchstädt]], riding that same night to meet with Marlborough at [[Schrobenhausen]]. Marlborough knew it was necessary that another crossing point over the Danube would be required in case Donauwörth fell to the enemy. On 7 August, therefore, the first of Baden's 15,000 Imperial troops (the remainder following two days later) left Marlborough's main force to besiege the heavily defended city of [[Ingolstadt]], {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=off}} farther down the Danube.<ref>Holmes: ''Marlborough: England's Fragile Genius'' p. 279. Many reliable historians argue (as did Mérode-Westerloo at the time) that this was largely a device to get the 'cautious and obstructive Margrave out of the way'. However, Marlborough had assured Heinsius that the siege made perfect sense, and there is no direct evidence that they deliberately contrived his absence.</ref>\n\nWith Eugene's forces at Höchstädt on the north bank of the Danube, and Marlborough's at Rain on the south bank, Tallard and the Elector debated their next move. Tallard preferred to bide his time, replenish supplies and allow Marlborough's Danube campaign to flounder in the colder weeks of Autumn; the Elector and Marsin, however, newly reinforced, were keen to push ahead. The French and Bavarian commanders eventually agreed on a plan and decided to attack Eugene's smaller force. On 9 August, the Franco-Bavarian forces began to cross to the north bank of the Danube.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 47</ref>\n\nOn 10 August, Eugene sent an urgent dispatch reporting that he was falling back to Donauwörth – \"The enemy have marched. It is almost certain that the whole army is crossing the Danube at [[Lauingen]] ... The plain of Dillingen is crowded with troops ... Everything, milord, consists in speed and that you put yourself forthwith in movement to join me tomorrow, without which I fear it will be too late.\" By a series of brilliant marches Marlborough concentrated his forces on Donauwörth and, by noon 11 August, the link-up was complete.<ref name=chandler141>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 141</ref>\n\nDuring 11 August, Tallard pushed forward from the river crossings at Dillingen; by 12 August, the Franco-Bavarian forces were encamped behind the small river Nebel near the village of Blenheim on the plain of Höchstädt. That same day Marlborough and Eugene carried out their own reconnaissance of the French position from the church spire at [[Tapfheim]], and moved their combined forces to Münster – {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} from the French camp. A French reconnaissance under the Marquis de Silly went forward to probe the enemy, but were driven off by Allied troops who had deployed to cover the pioneers of the advancing army, labouring to bridge the numerous streams in the area and improve the passage leading westwards to Höchstädt.<ref>Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times'', p. 842. The French had captured four prisoners. Under examination they declared that the whole Allied army was going to move off towards Nördlingen the next morning.</ref> Marlborough quickly moved forward two brigades under the command of General Wilkes and Brigadier Rowe to secure the narrow strip of land between the Danube and the wooded Fuchsberg hill, at the [[Schwenningen, Bavaria|Schwenningen]] defile.<ref name=coxe188>Coxe: ''Memoirs of the Duke of Marlborough'': vol.i. p. 188</ref>\n\nTallard's army numbered 56,000 men and 90 guns; the army of the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]], 52,000 men and 66 guns. Some Allied officers who were acquainted with the superior numbers of the enemy, and aware of their strong defensive position, ventured to remonstrate with Marlborough about the hazards of attacking; but the Duke was resolute – \"I know the danger, yet a battle is absolutely necessary, and I rely on the bravery and discipline of the troops, which will make amends for our disadvantages\".<ref name=coxe188/> Marlborough and Eugene decided to risk everything, and agreed to attack on the following day.\n\n==Battle==\n{{further information|Blenheim order of battle}}\n\n===The battlefield===\nThe battlefield stretched for nearly {{convert|4|mi|km}}. The extreme right flank of the Franco-Bavarian army was covered by the Danube; to the extreme left flank lay the undulating pine-covered hills of the Swabian Jura. A small stream, the Nebel, (the ground either side of which was soft and marshy and only fordable intermittently), fronted the French line. The French right rested on the village of Blenheim near where the Nebel flows into the Danube; the village itself was surrounded by hedges, fences, enclosed gardens, and meadows. Between Blenheim and the next village of [[Höchstädt an der Donau|Oberglauheim]] the fields of wheat had been cut to stubble and were now ideal to deploy troops. From Oberglauheim to the next hamlet of Lutzingen the terrain of ditches, thickets and brambles was potentially difficult ground for the attackers.<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p. 106</ref>\n\n===Initial manoeuvres===\n[[Image:Battle of Blenhiem - Situation about noon, 13 August 1704.gif|thumb|250px|The position of the forces at noon, 13 August. Marlborough took control of the left arm of the Allied forces including the attacks on Blenheim and Oberglauheim, whilst Eugene commanded the right including the attacks on [[Lutzingen]].]]\n\nAt 02:00 on 13 August, 40 squadrons were sent forward towards the enemy, followed at 03:00, in eight columns, by the main Allied force pushing over the Kessel. At about 06:00 they reached Schwenningen, {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} from Blenheim. The English and German troops who had held Schwenningen through the night joined the march, making a ninth column on the left of the army. Marlborough and Eugene made their final plans. The Allied commanders agreed that Marlborough would command 36,000 troops and attack Tallard's force of 33,000 on the left (including capturing the village of Blenheim), whilst Eugene, commanding 16,000 men would attack the Elector and Marsin's combined forces of 23,000 troops on the right wing; if this attack was pressed hard the Elector and Marsin would have no troops to send to aid Tallard on their right.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 57</ref> [[John Cutts, 1st Baron Cutts|Lieutenant-General John Cutts]] would attack Blenheim in concert with Eugene's attack. With the French flanks busy, Marlborough could cross the Nebel and deliver the fatal blow to the French at their centre. However, Marlborough would have to wait until Eugene was in position before the general engagement could begin.\n\nThe last thing Tallard expected that morning was to be attacked by the Allies – deceived by intelligence gathered from prisoners taken by de Silly the previous day, and assured in their strong natural position, Tallard and his colleagues were convinced that Marlborough and Eugene were about to retreat north-eastwards towards [[Nördlingen]].<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p. 108. Several sources (Churchill, Chandler) suggest that Marlborough had planted this corroborative 'evidence' on Tallard.</ref> Tallard wrote a report to this effect to King Louis that morning, but hardly had he sent the messenger when the Allied army began to appear opposite his camp.  \"I could see the enemy advancing ever closer in nine great columns\", wrote Mérode-Westerloo, \" ... filling the whole plain from the Danube to the woods on the horizon.\"<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p. 109</ref> Signal guns were fired to bring in the foraging parties and [[picket (military)|picquets]] as the French and Bavarian troops tried to draw into battle-order to face the unexpected threat.\n\nAt about 08:00 the French artillery on their right wing opened fire, answered by [[Holcroft Blood|Colonel Blood]]'s [[Artillery battery|batteries]].<ref>Churchill states 08:30</ref> The guns were heard by Baden in his camp before Ingolstadt, \"The Prince and the Duke are engaged today to the westward\", he wrote to the Emperor. \"Heaven bless them.\"<ref>Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times'', p. 848</ref> An hour later Tallard, the Elector, and Marsin climbed Blenheim's church tower to finalise their plans. It was settled that the Elector and Marsin would hold the front from the hills to Oberglauheim, whilst Tallard would defend the ground between Oberglauheim and the Danube. The French commanders were, however, divided as to how to utilise the Nebel: Tallard's tactic – opposed by Marsin and the Elector who felt it better to close their infantry right up to the stream itself – was to lure the allies across before unleashing their cavalry upon them, causing panic and confusion; whilst the enemy was struggling in the marshes, they would be caught in crossfire from Blenheim and Oberglauheim. The plan was sound if all its parts were implemented, but it allowed Marlborough to cross the Nebel without serious interference and fight the battle he had in mind.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 58</ref>\n\n===Deployment===\n[[File:The Battle of Hoechstaedt.jpg|thumb|250px|The Battle of Blenheim by [[Huchtenburg]]]]\nThe Franco-Bavarian commanders deployed their forces. In the village of Lutzingen, Count Maffei positioned five Bavarian battalions with a great battery of 16 guns at the village's edge. In the woods to the left of Lutzingen, seven French battalions under the Marquis de Rozel moved into place. Between Lutzingen and Oberglauheim the Elector placed 27 squadrons of cavalry – Count d'Arco commanded 14 Bavarian squadrons and Count Wolframsdorf had 13 more in support nearby. To their right stood Marsin's 40 French squadrons and 12 battalions. The village of Oberglauheim was packed with 14 battalions commanded by the Marquis de Blainville (including the effective Irish Brigade known as the '[[Flight of the Wild Geese|Wild Geese]]'). Six batteries of guns were ranged alongside the village.<ref name=falkner61>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 61</ref> On the right of these French and Bavarian positions, between Oberglauheim and Blenheim, Tallard deployed 64 French and Walloon squadrons (16 drawn from Marsin) supported by nine French battalions standing near the Höchstädt road. In the cornfield next to Blenheim stood three battalions from the Regiment de Roi. Nine battalions occupied the village itself, commanded by the Marquis de Clérambault. Four battalions stood to the rear and a further 11 were in reserve. These battalions were supported by Hautefeuille's 12 squadrons of dismounted dragoons.<ref name=falkner61 /> By 11:00 Tallard, the Elector, and Marsin were in place. Many of the Allied generals were hesitant to attack such a relatively strong position. The [[George Douglas-Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney|Earl of Orkney]] later confessed that, \"had I been asked to give my opinion, I had been against it.\"<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 62</ref>\n\nPrince Eugene was expected to be in position by 11:00, but due to the difficult terrain and enemy fire, progress was slow.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 63</ref> Lord Cutts' column – who by 10:00 had expelled the enemy from two water mills upon the Nebel – had already deployed by the river against Blenheim, enduring over the next three hours severe fire from a heavy six-gun battery posted near the village. The rest of Marlborough's army, waiting in their ranks on the forward slope, were also forced to bear the cannonade from the French artillery, suffering 2,000 casualties before the attack could even start.<ref>Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times'', p. 852</ref> Meanwhile, engineers repaired a stone bridge across the Nebel, and constructed five additional bridges or causeways across the marsh between Blenheim and Oberglauheim. Marlborough's anxiety was finally allayed when, just past noon, [[William Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan|Colonel Cadogan]] reported that Eugene's [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] and [[Denmark|Danish]] infantry were in place – the order for the general advance was given. At 13:00, Cutts was ordered to attack the village of Blenheim whilst Prince Eugene was requested to assault Lutzingen on the Allied right flank.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 66</ref>\n\n===Blenheim===\n[[Image:Battle of Blenheim Tapestry.jpg|thumb|250px|Part of the Battle of Blenheim tapestry at [[Blenheim Palace]] by [[Judocus de Vos]]. In the background is the village of [[Blindheim|Blenheim]]; in the middle ground are the two water mills that Rowe had to take to gain a bridgehead over the Nebel. The foreground shows an English grenadier with a captured French colour.]]\n\nCutts ordered Brigadier-General Archibald Rowe's brigade to attack. The English infantry rose from the edge of the Nebel, and silently marched towards Blenheim, a distance of some {{convert|150|yd|m}}. John Ferguson's Scottish brigade supported Rowe's left, and moved in perfect order towards the barricades between the village and the river, defended by Hautefeuille's dragoons. As the range closed to within {{convert|30|yd|m}}, the French fired a deadly volley. Rowe had ordered that there should be no firing from his men until he struck his sword upon the [[palisade]]s, but as he stepped forward to give the signal, he fell mortally wounded.<ref>Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times'', p. 853. Two of Rowe's staff officers were killed trying to carry him away: Lieutenant-Colonel Dalyell and Major Campbell.</ref> The survivors of the leading companies closed up the gaps in their torn ranks and rushed forward. Small parties penetrated the defences, but repeated French volleys forced the English back towards the Nebel, sustaining heavy casualties. As the attack faltered, eight squadrons of elite Gens d'Armes, commanded by the veteran Swiss officer, Beat-Jacques von Zurlauben, fell upon the English troops, cutting at the exposed flank of [[Royal Scots Fusiliers|Rowe's own regiment]].<ref>Churchill and Coxe states only three squadrons of Gens d'Armes. Rowe's own regiment lost their colours, but they were soon retrieved by the Hessians.</ref> However, Wilkes' [[Hesse|Hessian]] brigade, lying nearby in the marshy grass at the water's edge, stood firm and repulsed the Gens d'Armes with steady fire, enabling the English and Hessians to re-order and launch another attack.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 68</ref>\n\nAlthough the Allies were again repulsed, these persistent attacks on Blenheim eventually bore fruit, panicking Clérambault into making the worst French error of the day.<ref name=chandler145>Chandler: ''A Guide to the Battlefields of Europe'', p. 145</ref> Without consulting Tallard, Clérambault ordered his reserve battalions into the village, upsetting the balance of the French position and nullifying the French numerical superiority. \"The men were so crowded in upon one another\", wrote Mérode-Westerloo, \"that they couldn't even fire – let alone receive or carry out any orders.\"<ref name=chandler145/> Marlborough, spotting this error, now countermanded Cutts' intention to launch a third attack, and ordered him simply to contain the enemy within Blenheim; no more than 5,000 Allied soldiers were able to pen in twice the number of French infantry and dragoons.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 70</ref>\n\n===Lutzingen===\n:'' ... Prince Eugene and the Imperial troops had been repulsed three times – driven right back to the woods – and had taken a real drubbing.'' – Mérode-Westerloo.<ref>Spencer: ''Blenheim: Battle for Europe'', p. 270</ref>\n[[Image:Spanischer Erbfolgekrieg 1704, Lutzingen, Germany.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Memorial for the Battle of Blenheim 1704, [[Lutzingen]], Germany.]]\n\nOn the Allied right, Eugene's Prussian and Danish forces were desperately fighting the numerically superior forces of the Elector and Marsin. The [[Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau|Prince of Anhalt-Dessau]] led forward four brigades across the Nebel to assault the well-fortified position of Lutzingen. Here, the Nebel was less of an obstacle, but the great battery positioned on the edge of the village enjoyed a good field of fire across the open ground stretching to the hamlet of Schwennenbach. As soon as the infantry crossed the stream, they were struck by Maffei's infantry, and salvoes from the Bavarian guns positioned both in front of the village and in [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] on the wood-line to the right. Despite heavy casualties the Prussians attempted to storm the great battery, whilst the Danes, under Count Scholten, attempted to drive the French infantry out of the copses beyond the village.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 71</ref>\n\nWith the infantry heavily engaged, Eugene's cavalry picked its way across the Nebel. After an initial success, his first line of cavalry, under the Imperial General of Horse, [[Maximilian Wilhelm of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Prince Maximilian of Hanover]], were pressed by the second line of Marsin's cavalry, and were forced back across the Nebel in confusion. Nevertheless, the exhausted French were unable to follow up their advantage, and the two cavalry forces tried to regroup and reorder their ranks.<ref>Tincey: ''Blenheim 1704: The Duke of Marlborough's Masterpiece'', p. 67</ref> However, without cavalry support, and threatened with envelopment, the Prussian and Danish infantry were in turn forced to pull back across the Nebel. Panic gripped some of Eugene's troops as they crossed the stream. Ten infantry colours were lost to the Bavarians, and hundreds of prisoners taken; it was only through the leadership of Eugene and the Prussian Prince that the imperial infantry were prevented from abandoning the field.<ref>Spencer: ''Blenheim: Battle for Europe'', p. 268</ref>\n\nAfter rallying his troops near Schwennenbach – well beyond their starting point – Eugene prepared to launch a second attack, led by the second-line squadrons under the [[Eberhard Ludwig, Duke of Württemberg|Duke of Württemberg-Teck]]. Yet again they were caught in the murderous cross-fire from the artillery in Lutzingen and Oberglauheim, and were once again thrown back in disarray. The French and Bavarians, however, were almost as disordered as their opponents, and they too were in need of inspiration from their commander, the Elector, who was seen – \" ... riding up and down, and inspiring his men with fresh courage.\"<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 73</ref> Anhalt-Dessau's Danish and Prussian infantry attacked a second time but could not sustain the advance without proper support. Once again they fell back across the stream.\n\n===Centre and Oberglauheim===\n[[File:Battle of Blenheim - Joshua Ross jr.jpg|thumb|The Battle of Blenheim by Joshua Ross]]\n:'' ... they began to pass [the marshes and the Nebel] as fast as the badness of the ground would permit them.'' –  Churchill's chaplain.<ref>Spencer: ''Blenheim: Battle for Europe'', p. 258</ref>\n\nWhilst these events around Blenheim and Lutzingen were taking place, Marlborough was preparing to cross the Nebel. The centre, commanded by the Duke's brother, General Charles Churchill, consisted of 18 battalions of infantry arranged in two lines: seven battalions in the front line to secure a foothold across the Nebel, and 11 battalions in the rear providing cover from the Allied side of the stream. Between the infantry were placed two lines, 72 squadrons of cavalry. The first line of foot was to pass the stream first and march as far to the other side as could be conveniently done. This line would then form and cover the passage of the horse, leaving gaps in the line of infantry large enough for the cavalry to pass through and take their position in front.\n\n[[File:Camille d'Hostun duc de Tallard.png|thumb|180px|left|[[Camille d'Hostun, duc de Tallard|Marshal Tallard]] (1652–1728). He has been criticized for allowing Clérambault to maintain a force of infantry in Blenheim so large that it denied the main army manpower it needed.]]\n\nMarlborough ordered the formation forward. Once again Zurlauben's Gens d'Armes charged, looking to rout [[Henry Lumley|Lumley]]'s English cavalry who linked Cutts' column facing Blenheim with Churchill's infantry. As these elite French cavalry attacked, they were faced by five English squadrons under Colonel Francis Palmes. To the consternation of the French, the Gens d'Armes were pushed back in terrible confusion, pursued well beyond the Maulweyer stream that flows through Blenheim.<ref name =falkner76>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 76. In his account after the battle, Tallard explains his defeat – \"first, because the Gendarmerie were not able to break the five English squadrons.\"</ref> \"What? Is it possible?\" exclaimed the Elector, \"the gentlemen of France fleeing?\"<ref>Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times'', p. 856</ref> Palmes, however, attempted to follow up his success but was repulsed in some confusion by other French cavalry, and musketry fire from the edge of Blenheim.<ref name=falkner76/>\n\nNevertheless, Tallard was alarmed by the repulse of the elite Gens d'Armes and urgently rode across the field to ask Marsin for reinforcements; but on the basis of being hard pressed by Eugene – whose second attack was in full flood – Marsin refused.<ref name=falkner77>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 77</ref> As Tallard consulted with Marsin, more of his infantry was being taken into Blenheim by Clérambault. Fatally, Tallard, aware of the situation, did nothing to rectify this grave mistake, leaving him with just the nine battalions of infantry near the Höchstädt road\nto oppose the massed enemy ranks in the centre.<ref name=falkner77/> Zurlauben tried several more times to disrupt the Allies forming on Tallard's side of the stream; his front-line cavalry darting forward down the gentle slope towards the Nebel. But the attacks lacked co-ordination, and the Allied infantry's steady volleys disconcerted the French horsemen.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 78</ref> During these skirmishes Zurlauben fell mortally wounded, and died two days later. The time was just after 15:00.\n\nThe Danish cavalry, under the [[Carl Rudolf, Duke of Württemberg-Neuenstadt|Duke of Württemberg-Neuenstadt]] (not to be confused with the Duke of Württemberg who fought with Eugene), had made slow work of crossing the Nebel near Oberglau; harassed by Marsin's infantry near the village, the Danes were driven back across the stream. Count Horn's Dutch infantry managed to push the French back from the water's edge, but it was apparent that before Marlborough could launch his main effort against Tallard, Oberglauheim would have to be secured.\n[[File:Allied attack on Oberglau.png|thumb|250px|Allied attack on [[Höchstädt an der Donau|Oberglauheim]].]]\nCount Horn directed the [[Anton Günther, Prince of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck|Prince of Holstein-Beck]] to take the village, but his two Dutch brigades were cut down by the French and Irish troops, capturing and badly wounding the Prince during the action.<ref>Spencer: ''Blenheim: Battle for Europe'', p. 264</ref> The battle was now in the balance. If Holstein-Beck's Dutch column were destroyed, the Allied army would be split in two: Eugene's wing would be isolated from Marlborough's, passing the initiative to the Franco-Bavarian forces now engaged across the whole plain.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 80. Tallard later recorded – \"At this moment I saw the hope of victory.\"</ref> Seeing the opportunity, Marsin ordered his cavalry to change from facing Eugene, and turn towards their right and the open flank of Churchill's infantry drawn up in front of Unterglau. Marlborough (who had crossed the Nebel on a makeshift bridge to take personal control), ordered Hulsen's Hanoverian battalions to support the Dutch infantry. A Dutch cavalry brigade under Averock was also called forward but soon came under pressure from Marsin's more numerous squadrons.\n\nMarlborough now requested Eugene to release Count Hendrick Fugger and his Imperial Cuirassier brigade to help repel the French cavalry thrust. Despite his own desperate struggle, the Imperial Prince at once complied, demonstrating the high degree of confidence and mutual co-operation between the two generals.<ref>Chandler: ''A Guide to the Battlefields of Europe'', p. 161</ref> Although the Nebel stream lay between Fugger's and Marsin's squadrons, the French were forced to change front to meet this new threat, thus forestalling the chance for Marsin to strike at Marlborough's infantry.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 81</ref> Fugger's [[cuirassiers]] charged and, striking at a favourable angle, threw back Marsin's squadrons in disorder.<ref>Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times'', p. 858</ref> With support from Colonel Blood's batteries, the Hessian, Hanoverian and Dutch infantry – now commanded by Count Berensdorf – succeeded in pushing the French and Irish infantry back into Oberglauheim so that they could not again threaten Churchill's flank as he moved against Tallard. The French commander in the village, the Marquis de Blainville, numbered amongst the heavy casualties.<ref name=falkner82>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 82</ref>\n\n===Breakthrough===\n:''The [French] foot remained in the best order I ever saw, till they were cut to pieces almost in rank and file.'' – [[George Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney|Lord Orkney]].<ref name=falkner86>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 86</ref>\n[[Image:Battle of Blenheim - Penetration, 1730, 13 August 1704.gif|thumb|250px|Breakthrough: Position of the battle at 17:30.]]\n\nBy 16:00, with the Franco-Bavarian troops besieged in Blenheim and Oberglau, the Allied centre of 81 squadrons (nine squadrons had been transferred from Cutts' column), supported by 18 battalions was firmly planted amidst the French line of 64 squadrons and nine battalions of raw recruits. There was now a pause in the battle: Marlborough wanted to concert the attack upon the whole front, and Eugene, after his second repulse, needed time to reorganize.<ref>Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times'', p. 860</ref>\n\nJust after 17:00 all was ready along the Allied front. Marlborough's two lines of cavalry had now moved to the front of the Duke's line of battle, with the two supporting lines of infantry behind them. [[Jean-Philippe-Eugène de Mérode-Westerloo|Mérode-Westerloo]] attempted to extricate some French infantry crowded in Blenheim, but Clérambault ordered the troops back into the village. The French cavalry exerted themselves once more against the first line – Lumley's English and Scots on the Allied left, and Hompesch's Dutch and German squadrons on the Allied right. Tallard's squadrons, lacking infantry support, were tired and ragged but managed to push the Allied first line back to their infantry support. With the battle still not won, Marlborough had to rebuke one of his cavalry officers who was attempting to leave the field – \"Sir, you are under a mistake, the enemy lies that way ...\"<ref name=falkner86 /> Now, at the Duke's command, the second Allied line under Cuno Josua von Bülow and Bothmer was ordered forward, and, driving through the centre, the Allies finally put Tallard's tired horse to rout, not without cost. The Prussian Life Dragoons' Colonel, Ludwig [[von Blumenthal]], and his 2nd in command, Lt. Col. [[von Hacke]], fell next to each other. But the charge succeeded and with their cavalry in headlong flight, the remaining nine French infantry battalions fought with desperate valour, trying to form square.<ref name=falkner86 /> But it was futile. The French battalions were overwhelmed by Colonel Blood's close-range artillery and platoon fire. Mérode-Westerloo later wrote – \"[They] died to a man where they stood, stationed right out in the open plain – supported by nobody.\"<ref name=falkner86 />\n\nThe majority of Tallard's retreating troops headed for Höchstädt but most did not make the safety of the town, plunging instead into the Danube where upwards of 3,000 French horsemen drowned;<ref>Churchill states up to 2,000</ref> others were cut down by the pursuing cavalry. The Marquis de Gruignan attempted a counter-attack, but he was easily brushed aside by the triumphant Allies. After a final rally behind his camp's tents, shouting entreaties to stand and fight, Marshal Tallard was caught up in the rout and pushed towards Sonderheim.<ref name=falkner90>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 90</ref> Surrounded by a squadron of [[Hesse|Hessian]] troops, Tallard surrendered to Lieutenant-Colonel de Boinenburg, the [[Frederick I of Sweden|Prince of Hesse-Kassel]]'s ''[[aide-de-camp]]'', and was sent under escort to Marlborough.<ref>Tincey: ''Blenheim 1704: The Duke of Marlborough's Masterpiece'', p. 85</ref> The Duke welcomed the French commander – \"I am very sorry that such a cruel misfortune should have fallen upon a soldier for whom I have the highest regard.\" With salutes and courtesies, the Marshal was escorted to Marlborough's coach.<ref name=falkner90/>\n\n===Fall of Blenheim===\n[[File:Battle of Blenheim (1704)@01.JPG|thumb|250px|The Battle of Blenheim by [[John Wootton]]]]\n:'' ... our men fought in and through the fire ... until many on both sides were burned to death.'' – Private Deane, [[Grenadier Guards|1st Regiment Foot Guards]].<ref>Spencer: ''Blenheim: Battle for Europe'', p. 294</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the Allies had once again attacked the Bavarian stronghold at Lutzingen.\nEugene, however, became exasperated with the performance of his Imperial cavalry whose third attack had failed: he had already shot two of his troopers to prevent a general flight. Then, declaring in disgust that he wished to \"fight among brave men and not among cowards\", Eugene went into the attack with the Prussian and Danish infantry, as did the Dessauer, waving a regimental colour to inspire his troops.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 86</ref> This time the Prussians were able to storm the great Bavarian battery, and overwhelm the guns' crews.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 91</ref> Beyond the village, Scholten's Danes defeated the French infantry in a desperate hand-to-hand bayonet struggle.<ref>Danish infantry suffered 2,401 casualties fighting for possession of the woods beyond Lutzingen (Falkner)</ref> When they saw that the centre had broken, the Elector and Marsin decided the battle was lost and, like the remnants of Tallard's army, fled the battlefield (albeit in better order than Tallard's men). Attempts to organise an Allied force to prevent Marsin's withdrawal failed owing to the exhaustion of the cavalry, and the growing confusion in the field.\n\n[[Image:Battle of Blenhiem - Explotation, 13 August 1704.gif|left|thumb|250px|Pursuit]]\nMarlborough now had to turn his attention from the fleeing enemy to direct Churchill to detach more infantry to storm Blenheim. Orkney's infantry, Hamilton's English brigade and St Paul's Hanoverians moved across the trampled wheat to the cottages. Fierce hand-to-hand fighting gradually forced the French towards the village centre, in and around the walled churchyard which had been prepared for defence. Hay and Ross's dismounted dragoons were also sent, but suffered under a counter-charge delivered by the regiments of Artois and Provence under command of Colonel de la Silvière. Colonel Belville's Hanoverians were fed into the battle to steady the resolve of the dragoons, and once more went to the attack. The Allied progress was slow and hard, and like the defenders, they suffered many casualties.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 95</ref>\n\nMany of the cottages were now burning, obscuring the field of fire and driving the defenders out of their positions. Hearing the din of battle in Blenheim, Tallard sent a message to Marlborough offering to order the garrison to withdraw from the field.\n\"Inform Monsieur Tallard\", replied the Duke, \"that, in the position in which he is now, he has no command.\"<ref>Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times'', p. 865</ref> Nevertheless, as dusk came the Allied commander was anxious for a quick conclusion. The French infantry fought tenaciously to hold on to their position in Blenheim, but their commander was nowhere to be found. Clérambault's insistence on confining his huge force in the village was to seal his fate that day.<ref>Spencer: ''Blenheim: Battle for Europe'', p. 291</ref> Realising his tactical mistake had contributed to Tallard's defeat in the centre, Clérambault deserted Blenheim and the 27 battalions defending the village, and reportedly drowned in the Danube while attempting to make his escape.\n\n[[Image:Battle of Blenheim Diorama.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Diorama]] of the battle in the Höchstädt museum. In the middle ground the Allied cavalry are breaking through, pushing Tallard's squadrons from the battlefield. The foreground depicts the fierce fighting in and around Blenheim.]]\n\nBy now Blenheim was under assault from every side by three British generals: Cutts, Churchill, and Orkney. The French had repulsed every attack with heavy slaughter, but many had seen what had happened on the plain and what its consequences to them would be; their army was routed and they were cut off.<ref>Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times'', p. 867</ref> Orkney, attacking from the rear, now tried a different tactic – \"...&nbsp;it came into my head to beat parley\", he later wrote, \"which they accepted of and immediately their Brigadier de Nouville capitulated with me to be prisoner at discretion and lay down their arms.\" Threatened by Allied guns, other units followed their example. However, it was not until 21:00 that the Marquis de Blanzac, who had taken charge in Clérambault's absence, reluctantly accepted the inevitability of defeat, and some 10,000 of France's best infantry had laid down their arms.<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 98</ref>\n\nDuring these events Marlborough was still in the saddle conducting the pursuit of the broken enemy. Pausing for a moment he scribbled on the back of an old tavern bill a note addressed to his wife, [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Sarah]]: \"I have no time to say more but to beg you will give my duty to the Queen, and let her know her army has had a glorious victory.\"<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p. 121. The message was carried to London by Colonel Daniel Parke.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Pieter van Bloemen - The Duke of Marlborough and the Earl of Cadogan at Blenheim (Hochstadt).jpg|thumb|250px|Marlborough and Cadogan at the Battle of Blenheim by [[Pieter van Bloemen]]]]\n[[File:Joannes-Antonius-Florantin-Dicæomachia-sive-Erotemata MG 0920.tif|thumb|250px|Battle of Höchstädt by Wolfgang and Vind.]]\n\nFrench losses were immense, with over 27,000 killed, wounded and captured.{{sfn|Clodfelter|2017|p=185}}<ref name=barnett122>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p. 122</ref> Moreover, the myth of French invincibility had been destroyed and Louis's hopes of an early and victorious peace had been wrenched from his grasp.<ref name=barnett122/> Mérode-Westerloo summarised the case against Tallard's army: \"The French lost this battle for a wide variety of reasons. For one thing they had too good an opinion of their own ability ... Another point was their faulty field dispositions, and in addition there was rampant indiscipline and inexperience displayed ... It took all these faults to lose so celebrated a battle.\"<ref name=Chandler149>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 149</ref> It was a hard-fought contest, leading Prince Eugene to observe – \"I have not a squadron or battalion which did not charge four times at least.\"<ref>Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 103</ref> Although the war dragged on for years, the Battle of Blenheim was probably its most decisive victory; Marlborough and Eugene, working indivisibly together, had saved the Habsburg Empire and thereby preserved the Grand Alliance from collapse.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 88</ref> [[Munich]], Augsburg, Ingolstadt, Ulm and all remaining territory of Bavaria soon fell to the Allies. By the [[Treaty of Ilbersheim]], signed 7 November 1704, Bavaria was placed under Austrian military rule, allowing the Habsburgs to utilise its resources for the rest of the conflict.<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667–1714'', p. 293</ref>\n\nThe remnants of the [[Maximilian II Emanuel, elector of Bavaria|Elector of Bavaria's]] and Marshal Marsin's wing limped back to Strasbourg, losing another 7,000 men through desertion.<ref name=Chandler149/> Despite being offered the chance to remain as ruler of Bavaria (under strict terms of an alliance with Austria), the Elector left his country and family in order to continue the war against the Allies from the Spanish Netherlands where he still held the post of governor-general. Their commander-in-chief that day, Marshal Tallard  – who, unlike his subordinates, had not been ransomed or exchanged – was taken to England and imprisoned in [[Nottingham]] until his release in 1711.<ref name=Tincey1>Tincey: ''Blenheim 1704: The Duke of Marlborough's Masterpiece'', p. 88</ref>\n\nThe 1704 campaign lasted considerably longer than usual as the Allies sought to wring out maximum advantage. Realising that France was too powerful to be forced to make peace by a single victory, however, Eugene, Marlborough and Baden met to plan their next moves. For the following year the Duke proposed a campaign along the valley of the River Moselle to carry the war deep into France. This required the capture of the major fortress of Landau which guarded the Rhine, and the towns of Trier and Trarbach on the Moselle itself.<ref name=Tincey1/> Trier was taken on 27 October and Landau fell on 23 November to the Margrave of Baden and Prince Eugene; with the fall of Trarbach on 20 December, the campaign season for 1704 came to an end.\n\nMarlborough returned to England on 14 December ([[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S]]) to the acclamation of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] and the country.

For the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]] – Austria, England, and the Dutch Republic – the battle had followed an indecisive campaign against the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] armies of King [[Louis XIV of France]] in 1705. Although the Allies had [[Siege of Barcelona (1705)|captured Barcelona]] that year, they had been forced to abandon their campaign on the [[Moselle River|Moselle]], had stalled in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and suffered defeat in northern Italy. Yet despite his opponents' setbacks Louis XIV was desirous of peace – but he wanted it on reasonable terms. For this end and in order to maintain their momentum, the French and their allies took the offensive in 1706.\n\nThe campaign began well for Louis XIV's generals: in Italy Marshal [[Louis Joseph, Duke of Vendôme|Vendôme]] had defeated the Austrians at the [[Battle of Calcinato]] in April, while in [[Alsace]] Marshal [[Claude Louis Hector de Villars|Villars]] had forced the [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Margrave of Baden]] back across the [[Rhine]]. Encouraged by these early gains Louis XIV urged Marshal [[François de Neufville, duc de Villeroi|Villeroi]] to go over to the offensive in the Spanish Netherlands and, with victory, gain a 'fair' peace. Accordingly, the French Marshal set off from [[Leuven]] (''Louvain'') at the head of 60,000 men and marched towards [[Tienen]] (''Tirlemont''), as if to threaten [[Zoutleeuw]] (''Léau''). Also determined to fight a major engagement, the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]], commander-in-chief of Anglo-Dutch forces, assembled his army – some 62,000 men – near [[Maastricht]], and marched past Zoutleeuw. With both sides seeking battle, they soon encountered each other on the dry ground between the [[Mehaigne]] and Petite Gheete rivers, close to the small village of [[Ramillies, Belgium|Ramillies]].\n\nIn less than four hours Marlborough's [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]], [[Kingdom of England|English]], and [[Denmark-Norway|Danish]] forces<ref>Denmark never joined the Grand Alliance, but Danish troops, hired by the Maritime Powers (England and the Dutch Republic), were central to Allied success at both the [[Battle of Blenheim]] in 1704 and Ramillies, 1706.</ref> overwhelmed Villeroi's and [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria|Max Emanuel]]'s Franco-Spanish-Bavarian army. The Duke's subtle moves and changes in emphasis during the battle – something his opponents failed to realise until it was too late – caught the French in a tactical <!-- VICE/VISE spelling: please note that this article is using British spelling and Vice is therefore the correct spelling -->vice. With their foe broken and routed, the Allies were able to fully exploit their victory. Town after town fell, including [[Brussels]], [[Bruges]] and [[Antwerp]]; by the end of the campaign Villeroi's army had been driven from most of the Spanish Netherlands. With Prince [[Prince Eugene of Savoy|Eugene]]'s subsequent success at the [[Battle of Turin]] in northern Italy, the Allies had imposed the greatest loss of territory and resources that Louis XIV would suffer during the war. Thus, the year 1706 proved, for the Allies, to be an ''[[annus mirabilis]]''.\n\n==Background==\nAfter their disastrous defeat at [[Battle of Blenheim|Blenheim]] in 1704, the next year brought the French some respite. The [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] had intended the 1705 campaign – an invasion of France through the [[Moselle River|Moselle]] valley – to complete the work of Blenheim and persuade King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] to make peace but the plan had been thwarted by friend and foe alike.<ref name=barnett140>Barnett: ''Marlborough,'' 140</ref> The reluctance of his Dutch allies to see their frontiers denuded of troops for another gamble in Germany had denied Marlborough the initiative<ref name=barnett140/> but of far greater importance was the [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Margrave of Baden]]’s pronouncement that he could not join the Duke in strength for the coming offensive. This was in part due to the sudden switching of troops from the Rhine to reinforce [[Prince Eugene of Savoy|Prince Eugene]] in Italy and part due to the deterioration of Baden’s health brought on by the re-opening of a severe foot wound he had received at the [[Battle of Schellenberg|storming of the Schellenberg]] the previous year.<ref name=chandler154>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 154</ref> Marlborough had to cope with the death of [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I]] in May and the accession of [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]], which unavoidably complicated matters for the Grand Alliance.<ref name=chandler154/>\n\nThe resilience of the French King and the efforts of his generals, also added to Marlborough’s problems.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 18</ref> Marshal [[François de Neufville, duc de Villeroi|Villeroi]], exerting considerable pressure on the Dutch commander, Count [[Henry de Nassau, Lord Overkirk|Overkirk]], along the [[Meuse River|Meuse]], took [[Huy]] on 10 June before pressing on towards [[Liège (city)|Liège]]. With Marshal Villars sitting strong on the [[Moselle]], the Allied commander – whose supplies had by now become very short – was forced to call off his campaign on 16 June. \"What a disgrace for Marlborough,\" exulted Villeroi, \"to have made false movements without any result!\"<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 157</ref> With Marlborough’s departure north, the French transferred troops from the Moselle valley to reinforce Villeroi in Flanders, while Villars marched off to the [[Rhine]].<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667–1714,'' 298</ref>\n\nThe Anglo-Dutch forces gained minor compensation for the failed Moselle campaign with the success at [[Battle of Elixheim|Elixheim]] and the crossing of the [[Lines of Brabant]] in the Spanish Netherlands (Huy was also retaken on 11 July) but a chance to bring the French to a decisive engagement eluded Marlborough.<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough,''  152</ref> The year 1705 proved almost entirely barren for the Duke, whose military disappointments were only partly compensated by efforts on the diplomatic front where, at the courts of [[Düsseldorf]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Vienna]], [[Berlin]] and [[Hanover]], Marlborough sought to bolster support for the Grand Alliance and extract promises of prompt assistance for the following year's campaign.<ref>\nChandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 164\n</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\nOn 11 January 1706, Marlborough finally reached [[London]] at the end of his diplomatic tour but he had already been planning his strategy for the coming season. The first option (although it is debatable to what extent the Duke was committed to such an enterprise) was a plan to transfer his forces from the Spanish Netherlands to northern Italy; once there, he intended linking up with Prince Eugene in order to defeat the French and safeguard [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoy]] from being overrun.<ref name=barnett58>Barnett: ''Marlborough,'' 158</ref> Savoy would then serve as a gateway into France by way of the mountain passes or an invasion with naval support along the Mediterranean coast via [[Nice]] and [[Toulon]], in connexion with redoubled Allied efforts in Spain.<ref>Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' 102.</ref> It seems that the Duke’s favoured scheme was to return to the Moselle valley (where Marshal [[Ferdinand de Marsin|Marsin]] had recently taken command of French forces) and once more attempt an advance into the heart of France.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 169</ref> But these decisions soon became academic. Shortly after Marlborough landed in the Dutch Republic on 14 April, news arrived of big Allied setbacks in the wider war.\n\nDetermined to show the Grand Alliance that France was still resolute, Louis XIV prepared to launch a double surprise in [[Alsace]] and northern Italy.<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough,'' 159</ref> On the latter front Marshal [[Louis Joseph de Bourbon, duc de Vendôme|Vendôme]] defeated the Imperial army at [[Battle of Calcinato|Calcinato]] on 19 April, pushing the Imperialists back in confusion (French forces were now in a position to prepare for the long-anticipated siege of [[Turin]]). In Alsace, Marshal Villars took Baden by surprise and captured [[Haguenau]], driving him back across the Rhine in some disorder, thus creating a threat on [[Landau]].<ref name=chandler168>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 168</ref> With these reverses, the Dutch refused to contemplate Marlborough's ambitious march to Italy or any plan that denuded their borders of the Duke and their army.<ref name=falkner33>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 33</ref> In the interest of coalition harmony, Marlborough prepared to campaign in the Low Countries.<ref name=falkner33/>\n\n===On the move===\n[[File:Low Countries 1700.png|thumb|300px|Map of the Low Countries during the War of the Spanish Succession. The village of Ramillies lies near the Mehaigne, a tributary of the Meuse.]]\nThe Duke left [[The Hague]] on 9 May. \"God knows I go with a heavy heart,\" he wrote six days later to his friend and political ally in England, Lord [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Godolphin]], \"for I have no hope of doing anything considerable, unless the French do what I am very confident they will not … \" – in other words, court battle.<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough,'' 160</ref> On 17 May the Duke concentrated his Dutch and English troops at [[Tongeren]], near [[Maastricht]]. The Hanoverians, Hessians and Danes, despite earlier undertakings, found, or invented, pressing reasons for withholding their support.<ref name=chandler168/> Marlborough wrote an appeal to the [[Carl Rudolf, Duke of Württemberg-Neuenstadt|Duke of Württemberg]], the commander of the Danish contingent – \"I send you this express to request your Highness to bring forward by a double march your cavalry so as to join us at the earliest moment …\"<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 38</ref> Additionally, the King ''in'' Prussia, [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]], had kept his troops in quarters behind the Rhine while his personal disputes with Vienna and the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] at The Hague remained unresolved. Nevertheless, the Duke could think of no circumstances why the French would leave their strong positions and attack his army, even if Villeroi was first reinforced by substantial transfers from Marsin’s command.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 170</ref> But in this he had miscalculated. Although Louis XIV wanted peace he wanted it on reasonable terms; for that, he needed victory in the field and to convince the Allies that his resources were by no means exhausted.<ref>Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' 103</ref>\n\n[[Image:John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough.png|thumb|left|170px|''John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough'' (1650–1722) by [[Sir Godfrey Kneller]].]]\n\nFollowing the successes in Italy and along the Rhine, Louis XIV was now hopeful of similar results in Flanders. Far from standing on the defensive therefore – and unbeknown to Marlborough – Louis XIV was persistently goading his marshal into action. \"[Villeroi] began to imagine,\" wrote [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|St Simon]], \"that the King doubted his courage, and resolved to stake all at once in an effort to vindicate himself.\"<ref>Saint-Simon: ''Memoirs, vol i,'' 298</ref> Accordingly, on 18 May, Villeroi set off from [[Leuven]] at the head of 70 [[battalion]]s, 132 [[Squadron (cavalry)|squadron]]s and 62 [[cannon]] – comprising an overall force of some 60,000 troops – and crossed the river [[Dijle|Dyle]] to seek battle with the enemy. Spurred on by his growing confidence in his ability to out-general his opponent, and by [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]’ determination to avenge Blenheim, Villeroi and his generals anticipated success.<ref>Villeroi was convinced that Marlborough had won the Battle of Blenheim by mere chance.</ref>\n\nNeither opponent expected the clash at the exact moment or place where it occurred.<ref name=chandler172>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 172</ref> The French moved first to [[Tienen]], (as if to threaten [[Zoutleeuw]], abandoned by the French in October 1705), before turning southwards, heading for [[Jodoigne]] – this line of march took Villeroi’s army towards the narrow aperture of dry ground between the [[Mehaigne]] and Petite Gheete rivers close to the small villages of Ramillies and Taviers; but neither commander quite appreciated how far his opponent had travelled. Villeroi still believed (on 22 May) the Allies were a full day’s march away when in fact they had camped near Corswaren waiting for the Danish squadrons to catch up; for his part, Marlborough deemed Villeroi still at Jodoigne when in reality he was now approaching the plateau of Mont St. André with the intention of pitching camp near Ramillies (see map at right).<ref name=chandler172/> However, the Prussian infantry was not there. Marlborough wrote to [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford (1672–1739)|Lord Raby]], the English resident at Berlin: \"If it should please God to give us victory over the enemy, the Allies will be little obliged to the King [Frederick] for the success.\"<ref>Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' 104</ref>\n\nThe following day, at 01:00, Marlborough dispatched [[William Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan|Cadogan]], his Quartermaster-General, with an advanced guard to reconnoitre the same dry ground that Villeroi’s army was now heading toward, country that was well known to the Duke from previous campaigns. Two hours later the Duke followed with the main body: 74 battalions, 123 squadrons, 90 pieces of artillery and 20 mortars, totalling 62,000 troops.<ref name=barnett161>Barnett: ''Marlborough,'' 161</ref> At about 08:00, after Cadogan had just passed Merdorp, his force made brief contact with a party of French [[hussar]]s gathering forage on the edge of the plateau of Jandrenouille. After a brief exchange of shots the French retired and Cadogan's dragoons pressed forward. With a short lift in the mist, Cadogan soon discovered the smartly ordered lines of Villeroi’s advance guard some {{convert|6|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} off; a galloper hastened back to warn Marlborough. Two hours later the Duke, accompanied by the Dutch field commander Field Marshal [[Henry de Nassau, Lord Overkirk|Overkirk]], General Daniel Dopff, and the Allied staff, rode up to Cadogan where on the horizon to the westward he could discern the massed ranks of the French army deploying for battle along the {{convert|6|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} front.<ref name=barnett161/> Marlborough later told Bishop Burnet that, ‘the French army looked the best of any he had ever seen’.<ref>Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' 106</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n===Battlefield===\nThe battlefield of Ramillies is very similar to that of Blenheim, for here too there is an immense area of arable land unimpeded by woods or hedges.<ref name=barnett162>Barnett: ''Marlborough,'' 162</ref> Villeroi’s right rested on the villages of Franquenée and Taviers, with the river Mehaigne protecting his flank. A large open plain, about {{convert|2|km|0|abbr=on}} wide, lay between Taviers and Ramillies, but unlike Blenheim, there was no stream to hinder the cavalry. His centre was secured by Ramillies itself, lying on a slight eminence which gave distant views to the north and east. The French left flank was protected by broken country, and by a stream, the Petite Gheete, which runs deep between steep and slippery slopes. On the French side of the stream the ground rises to Offus, the village which, together with Autre-Eglise farther north, anchored Villeroi’s left flank. To the west of the Petite Gheete rises the plateau of Mont St. André; a second plain, the plateau of Jandrenouille – upon which the Anglo-Dutch army amassed – rises to the east.<ref name=barnett162/>\n\n===Initial dispositions===\n[[Image:Ramillies 1706, initial attack.png|thumb|250px|Initial attack at the Battle of Ramillies, 23 May 1706. To the south, between Taviers and Ramillies, both commanders positioned the bulk of their cavalry. It was here where Marlborough made the breakthrough.]]\n\nAt 11:00, the Duke ordered the army to take standard battle formation. On the far right, towards Foulz, the British battalions and squadrons took up their posts in a double line near the Jeuche stream. The centre was formed by the mass of Dutch, German, Protestant Swiss and Scottish infantry – perhaps 30,000 men – facing Offus and Ramillies. Also facing Ramillies Marlborough placed a powerful battery of thirty 24-pounders, dragged into position by a team of oxen; further batteries were positioned overlooking the Petite Gheete. On their left, on the broad plain between Taviers and Ramillies – and where Marlborough thought the decisive encounter must take place<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough,'' 163</ref> – Overkirk drew the 69 squadrons of the Dutch and Danish horse, supported by 19 battalions of Dutch infantry and two artillery pieces.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 173</ref>\n\n[[Image:Joseph Vivien 001.jpg|thumb|170px|left|''Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria'', (1662-1726) by [[Joseph Vivien]].]]\n\nMeanwhile, Villeroi deployed his forces. In Taviers on his right, he placed two battalions of the Greder Suisse Régiment, with a smaller force forward in Franquenée; the whole position was protected by the boggy ground of the Mehaigne river, thus preventing an Allied flanking movement.<ref>Falkner: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667–1714,'' 50</ref> In the open country between Taviers and Ramillies, he placed 82 squadrons under General de Guiscard supported by several interleaved brigades of French, Swiss and Bavarian infantry. Along the Ramillies–Offus–Autre Eglise ridge-line, Villeroi positioned Walloon and Bavarian infantry, supported by the [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria|Elector of Bavaria's]] 50 squadrons of Bavarian and Walloon cavalry placed behind on the plateau of Mont St. André. Ramillies, Offus and Autre-Eglise were all packed with troops and put in a state of defence, with alleys barricaded and walls loop-holed for [[muskets]].<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 51</ref> Villeroi also positioned powerful batteries near Ramillies. These guns (some of which were of the three barrelled kind first seen at Elixheim the previous year) enjoyed good arcs of fire, able to fully cover the approaches of the plateau of Jandrenouille over which the Allied infantry would have to pass.\n\nMarlborough, however, noticed several important weaknesses in the French dispositions.<ref>Chandler: ''A Guide to the Battlefields of Europe,'' 30</ref> Tactically, it was imperative for Villeroi to occupy Taviers on his right and Autre-Eglise on his left, but by adopting this posture he had been forced to over-extend his forces.<ref name=lynn304>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667–1714,'' 304</ref> Moreover, this disposition – concave in relation to the Allied army – gave Marlborough the opportunity to form a more compact line, drawn up in a shorter front between the ‘horns’ of the French crescent; when the Allied blow came it would be more concentrated and carry more weight. Additionally, the Duke’s disposition facilitated the transfer of troops across his front far more easily than his foe, a tactical advantage that would grow in importance as the events of the afternoon unfolded.<ref name=lynn304/> Although Villeroi had the option of enveloping the flanks of the Allied army as they deployed on the plateau of Jandrenouille – threatening to encircle their army – the Duke correctly gauged that the characteristically cautious French commander was intent on a defensive battle along the ridge-line.<ref>Falkner: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667–1714,'' 55</ref>\n\n===Taviers===\nAt 13:00 the batteries went into action; a little later two Allied columns set out from the extremities of their line and attacked the flanks of the Franco-Bavarian army.<ref name=chandlertwo31>Chandler: ''A Guide to the Battlefields of Europe,'' 31</ref> To the south the [[Dutch Blue Guards|Dutch Guards]], under the command of Colonel Wertmüller, came forward with their two field guns to seize the hamlet of Franquenée. The small Swiss garrison in the village, shaken by the sudden onslaught and unsupported by the battalions to their rear, were soon compelled back towards the village of Taviers. Taviers was of particular importance to the Franco-Bavarian position: it protected the otherwise unsupported flank of General de Guiscard’s cavalry on the open plain, while at the same time, it allowed the French infantry to pose a threat to the flanks of the Dutch and Danish squadrons as they came forward into position.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 57</ref> But hardly had the retreating Swiss rejoined their comrades in that village when the Dutch Guards renewed their attack. The fighting amongst the alleys and cottages soon deteriorated into a fierce bayonet and clubbing ''mêlée'', but the superiority in Dutch firepower soon told. The accomplished French officer, Colonel de la Colonie, standing on the plain nearby remembered – \"this village was the opening of the engagement, and the fighting there was almost as murderous as the rest of the battle put together.\"<ref>La Colonie: ''The Chronicles of an old Campaigner,'' 306</ref> By about 15:00 the Swiss had been pushed out of the village into the marshes beyond.\n\n[[Image:François de Neufville, duc de Villeroi.png|thumb|170px|left|''François de Neufville, Duke of Villeroi, Marshal of France'', (1644–1730) by [[Alexandre-François Caminade]]. The Battle of Ramillies was Villeroi’s last command.]]\n\nVilleroi’s right flank fell into chaos and was now open and vulnerable.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 61</ref> Alerted to the situation de Guiscard ordered an immediate attack with 14 squadrons of French dragoons currently stationed in the rear. Two other battalions of the Greder Suisse Régiment were also sent, but the attack was poorly co-ordinated and consequently went in piecemeal. The Anglo-Dutch commanders now sent dismounted Dutch dragoons into Taviers, which, together with the Guards and their field guns, poured concentrated musketry- and canister-fire into the advancing French troops. Colonel d’Aubigni, leading his regiment, fell mortally wounded.<ref name=colonie309>La Colonie: ''The Chronicles of an old Campaigner,'' 309</ref>\n\nAs the French ranks wavered, the leading squadrons of Württemberg’s Danish horse – now unhampered by enemy fire from either village – were also sent into the attack and fell upon the exposed flank of the Franco-Swiss infantry and dragoons.<ref name=chandler175>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 175</ref> De la Colonie, with his Grenadiers Rouge regiment, together with the Cologne Guards who were brigaded with them, was now ordered forward from his post south of Ramillies to support the faltering counter-attack on the village. But on his arrival, all was chaos – \"Scarcely had my troops got over when the dragoons and Swiss who had preceded us, came tumbling down upon my battalions in full flight … My own fellows turned about and fled along with them.\"<ref name=colonie309/> De La Colonie managed to rally some of his grenadiers, together with the remnants of the French dragoons and Greder Suisse battalions, but it was an entirely peripheral operation, offering only fragile support for Villeroi’s right flank.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 65</ref>\n\n===Offus and Autre-Eglise===\n[[Image:George Hamilton, Earl of Orkney.jpg|thumb|170px|''Field Marshal George Hamilton 1666-1737 Earl of Orkney'', by [[Martin Maingaud]].]]\n\nWhile the attack on Taviers went in the [[George Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney|Earl of Orkney]] launched his first line of English across the Petite Gheete in a determined attack against the barricaded villages of Offus and Autre-Eglise on the Allied right. Villeroi, posting himself near Offus, watched anxiously the redcoats' advance, mindful of the counsel he had received on 6 May from Louis XIV – \"Have particular care to that part of the line which will endure the first shock of the English troops.\"<ref name=chandlertwo31/> Heeding this advice the French commander began to transfer battalions from his centre to reinforce the left, drawing more foot from the already weakened right to replace them.<ref name=chandler175/>\n\nAs the English battalions descended the gentle slope of the Petite Gheete valley, struggling through the boggy stream, they were met by Major General de la Guiche’s disciplined Walloon infantry sent forward from around Offus. After concentrated volleys, exacting heavy casualties on the redcoats, the Walloons reformed back to the ridgeline in good order. The English took some time to reform their ranks on the dry ground beyond the stream and press on up the slope towards the cottages and barricades on the ridge.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 69</ref> The vigour of the English assault, however, was such that they threatened to break through the line of the villages and out onto the open plateau of Mont St André beyond. This was potentially dangerous for the Allied infantry who would then be at the mercy of the Elector’s Bavarian and Walloon squadrons patiently waiting on the plateau for the order to move.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 71</ref>\n\nAlthough [[Henry Lumley]]’s English cavalry had managed to cross the marshy ground around the Petite Gheete, it was soon evident to Marlborough that sufficient cavalry support would not be practicable and that the battle could not be won on the Allied right.<ref name=chandler176>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 176</ref> The Duke, therefore, called off the attack against Offus and Autre-Eglise. To make sure that Orkney obeyed his order to withdraw, Marlborough sent his Quartermaster-General in person with the command. Despite Orkney’s protestations, Cadogan insisted on compliance and, reluctantly, Orkney gave the word for his troops to fall back to their original positions on the edge of the plateau of Jandrenouille. It is still not clear how far Orkney’s advance was planned only as a feint; according to historian David Chandler it is probably more accurate to surmise that Marlborough launched Orkney in a serious probe with a view to sounding out the possibilities of the sector.<ref name=chandler175/> Nevertheless, the attack had served its purpose. Villeroi had given his personal attention to that wing and strengthened it with large bodies of horse and foot that ought to have been taking part in the decisive struggle south of Ramillies.<ref>Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' 109</ref>\n\n===Ramillies===\n[[File:1706-05-23-Slag bij Ramillies.jpg|thumb|250px|The Battle of Ramillies]]\nMeanwhile, the Dutch assault on Ramillies was gaining pace. Marlborough’s younger brother, General of Infantry, [[Charles Churchill (British Army general)|Charles Churchill]], ordered four brigades of foot to attack the village. The assault consisted of 12 battalions of Dutch infantry commanded by Major Generals Schultz and Spaar; two brigades of Saxons under [[Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg|Count Schulenburg]]; a Scottish brigade in Dutch service led by the [[John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll|2nd Duke of Argyle]]; and a small brigade of Protestant Swiss.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 75</ref> The 20 French and Bavarian battalions in Ramillies, supported by the Irish dragoons who had left Ireland in the [[Flight of the Wild Geese]] to join [[Clare's Dragoons]] and a small brigade of Cologne and Bavarian Guards under the [[Alessandro, Marquis de Maffei|Marquis de Maffei]], put up a determined defence, initially driving back the attackers with severe losses<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 77</ref> as commemorated in the song ''Clare's Dragoons'':\n<poem>\nWhen on Ramillies' bloody field\nThe baffled French were forced to yield,\nThe victor Saxon backward reeled\nBefore the charge of Clare's Dragoons.\n\n''Viva là, the new brigade!''\n''Viva là the old one too!''\n''Viva là, the Rose shall fade''\n''The Shamrock shine forever new!''\n</poem>\nSeeing that Schultz and Spaar were faltering, Marlborough now ordered Orkney’s second-line British and Danish battalions (who had not been used in the assault on Offus and Autre-Eglise) to move south towards Ramillies. Shielded as they were from observation by a slight fold in the land, their commander, Brigadier-General Van Pallandt, ordered the regimental colours to be left in place on the edge of the plateau to convince their opponents they were still in their initial position. Therefore, unbeknown to the French who remained oblivious to the Allies’ real strength and intentions on the opposite side of the Petite Gheete, Marlborough was throwing his full weight against Ramillies and the open plain to the south. Villeroi meanwhile, was still moving more reserves of infantry in the opposite direction towards his left flank; crucially, it would be some time before the French commander noticed the subtle change in emphasis of the Allied dispositions.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 78</ref>\n\n[[Image:Hendrik van Nassau-Ouwerkerk.jpg|thumb|170px|''Henry of Nassau, Lord of Overkirk'' (1640-1708).]]\n\nAt around 15:30, Overkirk advanced his massed squadrons on the open plain in support of the infantry attack on Ramillies. Overkirk's squadrons – 48 Dutch, supported on their left by 21 Danish – steadily advanced towards the enemy (taking care not to prematurely tire the horses), before breaking into a trot to gain the impetus for their charge.<ref>La Colonie: ''The Chronicles of an old Campaigner,'' 313</ref> The [[Antoine de Pas de Feuquières|Marquis de Feuquières]] writing after the battle described the scene – \"They advanced in four lines … As they approached they advanced their second and fourth lines into the intervals of their first and third lines; so that when they made their advance upon us, they formed only one front, without any intermediate spaces.\"<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 80</ref>\n\nThe initial clash favoured the Dutch and Danish squadrons. The disparity of numbers – exacerbated by Villeroi stripping their ranks of infantry to reinforce his left flank – enabled Overkirk's cavalry to throw the first line of French horse back in some disorder towards their second-line squadrons. This line also came under severe pressure and, in turn, was forced back to their third-line of cavalry and the few battalions still remaining on the plain.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 81</ref> But these French horsemen were amongst the best in Louis XIV’s army – the ''[[Maison militaire du roi de France|Maison du Roi]]'',<ref>Maison du Roi (Household Cavalry): The mounted elements of the French ''Maison du Roi'' at Ramillies consisted of the ''Gardes du Corps'', the ''Royal Carabiniers'', the ''Mousquetaires'', the ''Compagnie des Grenadiers à Cheval'' and the ''Compagnie des Gens d’Armes''.</ref> supported by four elite squadrons of Bavarian Cuirassiers. Ably led by de Guiscard, the French cavalry rallied, thrusting back the Allied squadrons in successful local counterattacks.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 82</ref> On Overkirk’s right flank, close to Ramillies, ten of his squadrons suddenly broke ranks and were scattered, riding headlong to the rear to recover their order, leaving the left flank of the Allied assault on Ramillies dangerously exposed. Notwithstanding the lack of infantry support, de Guiscard threw his cavalry forward in an attempt to split the Allied army in two.\n\n[[Image:Decapitation of Colonel Bringfield.png|thumb|left|170px|Ten of Diamonds: The decapitation of Colonel Bringfield. A monument to Bringfield in the north aisle of [[Westminster Abbey]] recalls the tale.<ref>Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' 113</ref>]]\n\nA crisis threatened the centre, but from his vantage point Marlborough was at once aware of the situation.<ref name=chandler176/> The Allied commander now summoned the cavalry on the right wing to reinforce his centre, leaving only the English squadrons in support of Orkney. Thanks to a combination of battle-smoke and favourable terrain, his redeployment went unnoticed by Villeroi who made no attempt to transfer any of his own 50 unused squadrons.<ref name=chandler176/> While he waited for the fresh reinforcements to arrive, Marlborough flung himself into the ''mêlée'', rallying some of the Dutch cavalry who were in confusion. But his personal involvement nearly led to his undoing. A number of French horsemen, recognising the Duke, came surging towards his party. Marlborough’s horse tumbled and the Duke was thrown – \"Milord Marlborough was rid over,\" wrote Orkney some time later.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 83</ref> It was a critical moment of the battle. \"Major-General Murray,\" recalled one eye witness, \" … seeing him fall, marched up in all haste with two Swiss battalions to save him and stop the enemy who were hewing all down in their way.\"<ref name=barnett168>Barnett: ''Marlborough,'' 168</ref> Fortunately Marlborough’s newly appointed aide-de-camp, [[Richard Molesworth, 3rd Viscount Molesworth|Richard Molesworth]], galloped to the rescue, mounted the Duke on his horse and made good their escape, before Murray’s disciplined ranks threw back the pursuing French troopers.<ref name=barnett168/>\n\nAfter a brief pause, Marlborough’s equerry, Colonel Bringfield (or Bingfield), led up another of the Duke’s spare horses; but while assisting him onto his mount, the unfortunate Bringfield was hit by an errant cannonball that sheared off his head. One account has it that the cannonball flew between the Captain-General’s legs before hitting the unfortunate colonel, whose torso fell at Marlborough’s feet – a moment subsequently depicted in a lurid set of contemporary playing cards.<ref name=barnett168/> Nevertheless, the danger passed, enabling the Duke to attend to the positioning of the cavalry reinforcements feeding down from his right flank – a change of which Villeroi remained blissfully unaware.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 85</ref>\n\n===Breakthrough===\n[[Image:Ramillies 1706, breakthrough and pursuit.PNG|thumb|250px|Allied squadrons transferred from north to south gave the Allies a 5–3 advantage on the plain where some 25,000 French and Allied cavalry were heavily engaged.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 177</ref>]]\n\nThe time was about 16:30, and the two armies were in close contact across the whole {{convert|6|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} front, from the skirmishing in the marshes in the south, through the vast cavalry battle on the open plain; to the fierce struggle for Ramillies at the centre, and to the north, where, around the cottages of Offus and Autre-Eglise, Orkney and de la Guiche faced each other across the Petite Gheete ready to renew hostilities.\n\nThe arrival of the transferring squadrons now began to tip the balance in favour of the Allies. Tired, and suffering a growing list of casualties, the numerical inferiority of Guiscard’s squadrons battling on the plain at last began to tell.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 87</ref> After earlier failing to hold or retake Franquenée and Taviers, Guiscard’s right flank had become dangerously exposed and a fatal gap had opened on the right of their line. Taking advantage of this breach, Württemberg’s Danish cavalry now swept forward, wheeling to penetrate the flank of the Maison du Roi whose attention was almost entirely fixed on holding back the Dutch. Sweeping forwards, virtually without resistance, the 21 Danish squadrons reformed behind the French around the area of the Tomb of Ottomond, facing north across the plateau of Mont St André towards the exposed flank of Villeroi’s army.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 177. Trevelyan calls this the decisive manoeuvre of the day.</ref>\n\nThe final Allied reinforcements for the cavalry contest to the south were at last in position; Marlborough’s superiority on the left could no longer be denied, and his fast-moving plan took hold of the battlefield. Now, far too late, Villeroi tried to redeploy his 50 unused squadrons, but a desperate attempt to form line facing south, stretching from Offus to Mont St André, floundered amongst the baggage and tents of the French camp carelessly left there after the initial deployment.<ref>Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' 116. After the retreat had become general, further disaster and confusion resulted from the block of waggons breaking down in the mud. The artillery could not pass, resulting in the loss of most of Villeroi’s cannon.</ref> The Allied commander ordered his cavalry forward against the now heavily outnumbered French and Bavarian horsemen. De Guiscard’s right flank, without proper infantry support, could no longer resist the onslaught and, turning their horses northwards, they broke and fled in complete disorder.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 92</ref> Even the squadrons currently being scrambled together by Villeroi behind Ramillies could not withstand the onslaught. \"We had not got forty yards on our retreat,\" remembered Captain Peter Drake, an Irishmen serving with the French – \"when the words ''sauve qui peut'' went through the great part, if not the whole army, and put all to confusion\"<ref>Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' 115</ref>\n\nIn Ramillies the Allied infantry, now reinforced by the English troops brought down from the north, at last broke through. The Régiment de Picardie stood their ground but were caught between Colonel Borthwick’s Scots-Dutch regiment and the English reinforcements.

In addition, hundreds of French soldiers were fugitives, many of whom would never remuster to the [[Colours, standards and guidons|colours]]. Villeroi also lost 52 artillery pieces and his entire engineer [[Pontoon bridge|pontoon]] train.<ref name =falkner105>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 105</ref> In the words of Marshal Villars, the French defeat at Ramillies was – \"The most shameful, humiliating and disastrous of routs.\"<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough,'' 170</ref>\n\nTown after town now succumbed to the Allies. [[Leuven]] fell on 25 May 1706; three days later, the Allies entered [[Brussels]], the capital of the Spanish Netherlands. Marlborough realised the great opportunity created by the early victory of Ramillies: \"We now have the whole summer before us,\" wrote the Duke from Brussels to [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], \"and with the blessing of God I shall make the best use of it.\"<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 179</ref> [[Mechelen|Malines]], [[Lier, Belgium|Lierre]], [[Ghent]], [[Aalst, Belgium|Alost]], [[Damme]], [[Oudenaarde]], [[Bruges]], and on 6 June [[Antwerp]], all subsequently fell to Marlborough’s victorious army and, like Brussels, proclaimed the Austrian candidate for the Spanish throne, the [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles]], as their sovereign.<ref>Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' 121</ref> Villeroi was helpless to arrest the process of collapse. When Louis XIV learnt of the disaster he recalled Marshal Vendôme from northern Italy to take command in Flanders; but it would be weeks before the command changed hands.\n\n[[Image:Ramillies campaign 1706 - Allied gains.png|thumb|300px|left|Allied gains of the Ramillies campaign 1706. (Note: Dates of capitulation differ slightly depending on source).]]\n\nAs news spread of the Allies’ triumph, the Prussians, Hessians and Hanoverian contingents, long delayed by their respective rulers, eagerly joined the pursuit of the broken French and Bavarian forces. \"This,\" wrote Marlborough wearily, \"I take to be owing to our late success.\"<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 116</ref> Meanwhile, Overkirk took the port of [[Ostend]] on 4 July thus opening a direct route to the [[English Channel]] for communication and supply, but the Allies were making scant progress against [[Dendermonde]] whose governor, the [[Marquis de Valée]], was stubbornly resisting. Only later when Cadogan and Churchill went to take charge did the town’s defences begin to fail.<ref>Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' 118</ref>\n\nVendôme formally took over command in Flanders on 4 August;<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 181.

Dendermonde finally succumbed on 6 September followed by [[Ath]] – the last conquest of 1706 – on 2 October.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 182</ref> By the time Marlborough had closed down the Ramillies campaign he had denied the French most of the Spanish Netherlands west of the [[Meuse River|Meuse]] and north of the [[Sambre]] – it was an unsurpassed operational triumph for the English Duke but once again it was not decisive as these gains did not defeat France.<ref name=lynn308/>\n\nThe immediate question for the Allies now was how to deal with the Spanish Netherlands, a subject which the Austrians and the Dutch were diametrically opposed.<ref>Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' 132</ref> Emperor Joseph I, acting on behalf of his younger brother King ’Charles III’, absent in Spain, claimed that reconquered Brabant and Flanders should be put under immediate possession of a governor named by himself. The Dutch, however, who had supplied the major share of the troops and money to secure the victory (the Austrians had produced nothing of either) claimed the government of the region till the war was over, and that after the peace they should continue to garrison Barrier Fortresses stronger than those which had fallen so easily to Louis XIV’s forces in 1701. Marlborough mediated between the two parties but favoured the Dutch position. To sway the Duke’s opinion, the Emperor offered Marlborough the governorship of the Spanish Netherlands. It was a tempting offer, but in the name of Allied unity, it was one he refused.<ref>Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' 135. Marlborough never fully abandoned the hope that one day he might be proclaimed governor of the Spanish Netherlands. It was his own personal ambition that created mutual suspicion between the Duke and the Dutch.</ref> In the end England and the Dutch Republic took control of the newly won territory for the duration of the war; after which it was to be handed over to the direct rule of ‘Charles III’, subject to the reservation of a Dutch Barrier, the extent and nature of which had yet to be settled.<ref>The Dutch expected the Belgians to contribute to the cost of the war and the maintenance of the garrisons. Subsequently, the hardships felt by the Belgians led to serious military setbacks when in 1708, Bruges and Ghent swapped sides.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, on the Upper Rhine, Villars had been forced onto the defensive as battalion after battalion had been sent north to bolster collapsing French forces in Flanders; there was now no possibility of his undertaking the re-capture of Landau.<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667–1714,'' 309</ref> Further good news for the Allies arrived from northern Italy where, on 7 September, Prince Eugene had routed a French army before the [[Piedmont]]ese capital, [[Battle of Turin|Turin]], driving the Franco-Spanish forces from northern Italy. Only from Spain did Louis XIV receive any good news where [[António Luís de Sousa, 2nd Marquess of Minas|Das Minas]] and [[Henri de Massue, Earl of Galway|Galway]] had been forced to retreat from [[Madrid]] towards [[Valencia]], allowing [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] to re-enter his capital on 4 October. All in all though, the situation had changed considerably and Louis XIV began to look for ways to end what was fast becoming a ruinous war for France. For [[Queen Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] also, the Ramillies campaign had one overriding significance – \"Now we have God be thanked so hopeful a prospect of peace.\"<ref>Gregg: ''Queen Anne,'' 216</ref> Instead of continuing the momentum of victory, however, cracks in Allied unity would enable Louis XIV to reverse some of the major setbacks suffered at Turin and Ramillies.<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667–1714,'' 312</ref>\n\n==Casualties==\nThe total number of French casualties cannot be calculated precisely, so complete was the collapse of the Franco-Bavarian army that day.<ref name=falkner105/> [[David G. Chandler]]’s ''Marlborough as Military Commander'' and ''A Guide to the Battlefields of Europe'' are consistent with regards to French casualty figures i.e., 12,000 dead and wounded plus some 7,000 taken prisoner. James Falkner, in ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' also notes 12,000 dead and wounded and states ‘up to 10,000’ taken prisoner. In ''The Collins Encyclopaedia of Military History'', Dupuy puts Villeroi’s dead and wounded at 8,000, with a further 7,000 captured. John Millner’s memoirs – ''Compendious Journal'' (1733) – is more specific, recording 12,087 of Villeroi’s army were killed or wounded, with another 9,729 taken prisoner. In ''Marlborough'', however, [[Correlli Barnett]] puts the total casualty figure as high as 30,000 – 15,000 dead and wounded with an additional 15,000 taken captive. Trevelyan estimates Villeroi’s casualties at 13,000, but adds, ‘his losses by desertion may have doubled that number’. La Colonie omits a casualty figure in his ''Chronicles of an old Campaigner''; but Saint-Simon in his ''Memoirs'' states 4,000 killed, adding 'many others were wounded and many important persons were taken prisoner'. [[Voltaire]], however, in ''Histoire du siècle du Louis XIV'' records, 'the French lost there twenty thousand men'.\n\n==See also==\n*The battle was used as the name of several [[Royal Navy]] ships, [[HMS Ramillies|HMS ''Ramillies'']].\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n===Primary===\n* La Colonie, Jean Martin de.

They resulted in victory for the Royalists commanded by [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] over the Parliamentarians commanded by the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]].\n\n==Prelude==\nAfter defeating the army of Sir [[William Waller]] at the [[Battle of Cropredy Bridge]], King Charles marched west in pursuit of the Parliamentarian army of the Earl of Essex, who was invading the Royalist stronghold of [[Cornwall]].\n\nEssex had been misled into believing that he could expect substantial support from the people of Cornwall. When he had reached [[Bodmin]] on 28 July, he found that there was no chance of supplies or recruits, and he also learned that the Royalist army was at [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]], close to his rear. He withdrew to [[Lostwithiel]], covering the port of [[Fowey]]. Essex had previously arranged to rendezvous at Fowey with the Parliamentarian fleet under the [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]], but no ships appeared. Warwick was unable to leave [[Portsmouth]] because of westerly winds.\n\nCharles's army had been reinforced as it marched, and outnumbered that of Essex by nearly two to one. The first clashes took place on 2 August, but little action took place for several days, as the King waited for all his forces to arrive and Essex waited for the fleet.\n\n==Battle==\nOn 13 August, the Royalists began to attack in earnest, occupying several outposts on the east bank of the [[River Fowey]], making it even more difficult for help to reach Essex. A Parliamentarian attempt to send a relieving force under Lieutenant General [[John Middleton, 1st Earl of Middleton|Middleton]] was defeated at [[Bridgwater]] in [[Somerset]].\n\nOn 21 August, the Royalists attacked Essex's positions north of Lostwithiel, capturing the ruins of [[Restormel Castle]]. Royalist cavalry threatened to cut the Parliamentarians off from Fowey. Essex realised that there was no hope of relief and ordered his cavalry to break out of the encirclement. Under Sir [[William Balfour (general)|William Balfour]], they broke through the Royalist lines on the night of 31 August, eventually reaching [[Plymouth]] thirty miles to the east.\n\nThe increasingly demoralised Parliamentarian infantry fell back towards Fowey in pouring rain. They were forced to abandon several guns which became bogged down in the muddy roads. On 1 September, the pursuing Royalists captured [[Castle Dore]], another ruined fortification which the Parliamentarians were using to anchor their lines. Essex left Sir [[Philip Skippon]], his Sergeant Major General of Foot, in command while he himself escaped to Plymouth in a fishing boat.\n\nOn 2 September, Skippon, having been told that his infantry were unable to break out as the cavalry had done, and having been offered generous terms by the King, surrendered 6,000 infantry and all his army's guns and train.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe disarmed soldiers marched eastward to Portsmouth in continuing bad weather, being continually robbed and threatened by local people. About 1,000 died of exposure and hunger, and 1,000 more deserted or fell sick.\n\nCharles meanwhile wheeled about and marched towards London.\n\nThis setback for Parliament in [[Cornwall]], and the last major victory for the Royalists, was reversed by [[Sir Thomas Fairfax]] leading the [[New Model Army]] at or near [[Tresillian|Tresillian Bridge]], close to [[Truro]] on 12 March 1645.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Battle of Braddock Down]] which took place in January 1643 a few miles from Lostwithiel.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Cornwall in the Great Civil War and Interregnum 1642 - 1660''; by Mary Coate.

There was disagreement among the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff|U.S. Joint Chiefs]] over two proposed strategies to defeat the Japanese Empire. The strategy proposed by General [[Douglas MacArthur]] called for the recapture of the [[Philippines]], followed by the capture of [[Okinawa]], then an [[Operation Downfall|attack on the Japanese mainland]]. Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]] favored a more direct strategy of bypassing the Philippines, but seizing Okinawa and Taiwan as [[staging area]]s to an attack on the Japanese mainland, followed by the future invasion of Japan's southernmost islands.  Both strategies included the invasion of Peleliu, but for different reasons.<ref>{{cite web|title=Battle of Peleliu|url=http://www.history.com/topics/battle-of-peleliu|work=History Channel|accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]] had already been chosen to make the assault. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] traveled to [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] to personally meet both commanders and hear their arguments. MacArthur's strategy was chosen. However, before MacArthur could retake the Philippines, the [[Palau Islands]], specifically Peleliu and [[Angaur]], were to be neutralized and an airfield built to protect MacArthur's right flank.\n\n==Preparations==\n===Japanese===\n{{unreferenced|section|date=September 2017}}\nBy 1944, Peleliu Island was occupied by about 11,000 Japanese of the [[14th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|14th Infantry Division]] with Korean and [[Okinawa]]n laborers. Colonel [[Kunio Nakagawa]], commander of the division's 2nd Regiment, led the preparations for the island's defense.\n\nAfter their losses in the [[Solomon Islands campaign|Solomons]], [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign|Gilberts, Marshalls]] and [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign|Marianas]], the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Army]] assembled a research team to develop new island-defense tactics. They chose to abandon the old strategy of stopping the enemy at the beach. The new tactics would only disrupt the landings at the water's edge and depend on an in-depth defense farther inland. Colonel Nakagawa used the rough terrain to his advantage, by constructing a system of heavily fortified bunkers, caves and underground positions all interlocked into a \"honeycomb\" system. The old  \"[[banzai charge]]\" attack was also discontinued as being both wasteful of men and ineffective. These changes would force the Americans into a war of attrition requiring increasingly more resources.\n[[File:Peleliu-defense-194409.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Japanese fortifications]]\n\nNakagawa's defenses were based at Peleliu's highest point, Umurbrogol Mountain, a collection of hills and steep ridges located at the center of Peleliu overlooking a large portion of the island, including the crucial airfield. The Umurbrogol contained some 500 limestone caves, interconnected by tunnels. Many of these were former mine shafts that were turned into defense positions. Engineers added sliding armored steel doors with multiple openings to serve both artillery and machine guns. Cave entrances were built slanted as a defense against grenade and flamethrower attacks. The caves and bunkers were connected to a vast system throughout central Peleliu, which allowed the Japanese to evacuate or reoccupy positions as needed, and to take advantage of shrinking [[interior lines]].\n\nThe Japanese were well armed with [[Type 97 81 mm infantry mortar|{{convert|81|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}]] and [[Type 96 150 mm Infantry Mortar|{{convert|150|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} mortar]]s and [[Type 98 20 mm AA Machine Cannon|{{convert|20|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}]] [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] [[Autocannon|cannon]]s, backed by a light tank unit and an anti-aircraft detachment.\n\nThe Japanese also used the beach terrain to their advantage. The northern end of the landing beaches faced a {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} coral promontory that overlooked the beaches from a small peninsula, a spot later known to the Marines who assaulted it simply as \"The Point\". Holes were blasted into the ridge to accommodate a [[Type 1 47 mm Anti-Tank Gun|{{convert|47|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} gun]], and six 20-mm cannons. The positions were then sealed shut, leaving just a small firing slit to assault the beaches. Similar positions were crafted along the {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch of landing beaches.\n\nThe beaches were also filled with thousands of obstacles for the landing craft, principally mines and a large number of heavy artillery shells buried with the fuses exposed to explode when they were run over. A battalion was placed along the beach to defend against the landing, but they were meant to merely delay the inevitable American advance inland.\n\n===American===\n[[File:Battle of Peleliu2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|U.S. Marines in combat]]\n\nUnlike the Japanese, who drastically altered their tactics for the upcoming battle, the American invasion plan was unchanged from that of previous amphibious landings, even after suffering 3,000 casualties and two months of delaying tactics against the entrenched Japanese defenders at the [[Battle of Biak]].<ref>Alexander, ''Storm Landings'', p. 110.</ref> On Peleliu, American planners chose to land on the southwest beaches because of their proximity to the airfield on South Peleliu. The [[1st Marine Regiment (United States)|1st Marine Regiment]], commanded by Colonel [[Chesty Puller|Lewis B. Puller]], was to land on the northern end of the beaches. The [[5th Marine Regiment (United States)|5th Marine Regiment]], under Colonel [[Harold D. Harris]], would land in the center, and the [[7th Marine Regiment (United States)|7th Marine Regiment]], under Col. [[Herman Hanneken|Herman H. Hanneken]], would land at the southern end.\n\nThe division's artillery regiment, the [[11th Marine Regiment|11th Marines]] under Col. [[William H. Harrison (USMC)|William H. Harrison]], would land after the [[infantry]] regiments. The plan was for the 1st and 7th Marines to push inland, guarding the 5th Marines left and right flank, and allowing them to capture the airfield located directly to the center of the landing beaches. The 5th Marines were to push to the eastern shore, cutting the island in half. The 1st Marines would push north into the Umurbrogol, while the 7th Marines would clear the southern end of the island. Only one battalion was left behind in reserve, with the U.S. Army's 81st Infantry Division available for support from Angaur, just south of Peleliu.\n\nOn September 4, the Marines shipped off from their station on [[Pavuvu]], just north of [[Guadalcanal]], a {{convert|2100|mi|km|adj=on}} trip across the Pacific to Peleliu. A U.S. Navy's [[Underwater Demolition Team]] went in first to clear the beaches of obstacles, while [[United States Navy|Navy]] warships began their pre-invasion bombardment of Peleliu on September 12.\n\nThe [[battleship]]s {{USS|Pennsylvania|BB-38|2}}, {{USS|Maryland|BB-46|2}}, {{USS|Mississippi|BB-41|2}}, {{USS|Tennessee|BB-43|2}} and {{USS|Idaho|BB-42|2}}, [[heavy cruiser]]s {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|2}}, {{USS|Louisville|CA-28|2}}, {{USS|Minneapolis|CA-36|2}} and {{USS|Portland|CA-33|2}}, and [[light cruiser]]s  {{USS|Cleveland|CL-55|2}}, {{USS|Denver|CL-58|2}} and {{USS|Honolulu|CL-48|2}},<ref name=Moran/>{{rp|29}} led by the command ship {{USS|Mount McKinley|AGC-7|2}}, subjected the tiny island, only {{convert|6|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} in size, to a massive three-day bombardment, pausing only to permit air strikes from the three [[aircraft carrier]]s, five [[light aircraft carrier]]s, and eleven [[escort carrier]]s with the attack force.<ref name= Hastings>Hastings, '' Retribution'', pp. 236-244.</ref> A total of 519 rounds of {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} shells, 1,845 rounds of {{convert|14|in|mm|abbr=on}} shells and 1,793 {{convert|500|lb|kg|abbr=on}} bombs were dropped on the islands during this period.\n\nThe Americans believed the bombardment to be successful, as [[Rear Admiral]] [[Jesse Oldendorf]] claimed that the Navy had run out of targets.<ref name= Hastings/> In reality, the majority of the Japanese positions were completely unharmed. Even the battalion left to defend the beaches was virtually unscathed. During the assault, the island's defenders exercised unusual firing discipline to avoid giving away their positions. The bombardment managed only to destroy Japan's aircraft on the island, as well as the buildings surrounding the airfield. The Japanese remained in their fortified positions, ready to attack the American landing troops.\n\n==Battle==\n===Landing===\n[[File:Battle of Peleliu map.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Routes of Allied landings on Peleliu, 15 September 1944]]\n\nU.S. Marines landed on Peleliu at 08:32, on September 15, the 1st Marines to the north on White Beach 1 and 2 and the 5th and 7th Marines to the center and south on Orange Beach 1, 2, and 3.<ref name=Moran>Moran, J. and Rottman, G.L., 2002, Peleliu 1944, Oxford: Osprey Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|1841765120}}</ref>{{rp|42–45}} As the other landing craft approached the beaches, the Marines were caught in a crossfire when the Japanese opened the steel doors guarding their positions and fired artillery. The positions on the coral promontories guarding each flank fired on the Marines with 47-mm guns and 20-mm cannons. By 09:30, the Japanese had destroyed 60 [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVT]]s and [[DUKW]]s.\n[[File:Orange Beach 2 - Peleliu.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[5th Marine Regiment (United States)|5th Marines]] on Orange Beach]]\n\nThe 1st Marines were quickly bogged down by heavy fire from the extreme left flank and a 30-foot-high coral ridge, \"The Point\".<ref name=Moran/>{{rp|49}} Colonel [[Chesty Puller]] narrowly escaped death when a dud high velocity artillery round struck his LVT.

They found two units, the 16th Marine Field Depot and 17th (special) Seabees. They were not certain what their officers would think because both were segregated units but they knew they needed help. The 17th Seabees were assigned to the 1st Pioneers as shore party.  They carried the wounded, buried the dead, reinforced the line where directed, provided a crew for a  37mm gun, and volunteered for anything. On the first night nearly the entire battalion humped ammo to the front and it is written that they remained there several days. For their efforts they received an official a \"Well Done\". The 33rd NCB also had 202 men assigned to the shore party.<ref>Seabee Museum Archives, Port Hueneme, CA. 93043.  17th Special; NCB '''p. 29'''[https://www.history.navy.mil/content/dam/museums/Seabee/Cruisebooks/wwiicruisebooks/specials-cruisebooks/17%20Special.pdf]</ref><ref>World War II Database [http://worldwar2database.com/gallery/wwii1431 World War II Database]</ref><ref>[http://worldwar2database.com/gallery/wwii1429 16th Field Depot]</ref><ref>[https://www.history.navy.mil/content/dam/museums/Seabee/UnitListPages/SPECIALS/17%20SNCB.pdf 17th Special ,Seabee Museum]</ref><ref>[http://www.thomas5.com/tribute/Vets10.html Peleliu Shore Party Group]</ref>\n\n===The airfield/South Peleliu===\n[[File:Wounded Marine on Peleliu.jpg|thumb|A wounded Marine receives a drink from a [[Hospital corpsman|Navy corpsman]]]]\n\nOn the second day, the 5th Marines moved to capture the airfield and push toward the eastern shore.<ref name=Moran/>{{rp|61}} They ran across the airfield, enduring heavy artillery fire from the highlands to the north, suffering heavy casualties in the process. After capturing the airfield, they rapidly advanced to the eastern end of Peleliu, leaving the island's southern defenders to be destroyed by the 7th Marines.<ref name=Moran/>{{rp|58}}\n\nThis area was hotly contested by the Japanese, who still occupied numerous pillboxes. Heat indices<ref>http://www.srh.noaa.gov/ama/?n=heatindex</ref> were around<ref>http://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/palau/peleliu.php</ref> {{convert|115|°F|°C|abbr=on}}, and the Marines soon suffered high casualties from [[heat exhaustion]]. Further complicating the situation, the Marines' water was distributed in empty oil drums, contaminating the water with the oil residue.<ref name=Hough_94/> Still, by the eighth day the 5th and 7th Marines had accomplished their objectives, holding the airfield and the southern portion of the island, although the airfield remained under threat of sustained Japanese fire from the heights of Umurbrogol Mountain until the end of the battle.<ref name= Hastings/>\n\nAmerican forces put the airfield to use on the third day. [[L-2 Grasshopper]]s from [[VMO-1]] began [[Aerial observer|aerial spotting]] missions for Marine artillery and [[naval gunfire support]]. On September 26 (D+11), Marine [[Vought F4U Corsair|F4U Corsair]]s from [[VMF-114]] landed on the airstrip. The Corsairs began [[dive-bombing]] missions across Peleliu, firing rockets into open cave entrances for the infantrymen, and dropping [[napalm]]; it was only the second time the latter weapon had been used in the Pacific.{{Citation needed|reason=Statistical claim re: napalm needs support|date=December 2016}} Napalm proved useful, burning away the vegetation hiding [[spider hole]]s and usually killing their occupants.\n\nThe time from liftoff to the target area for the Corsairs based on Peleliu Airfield was very short, sometimes only 10 to 15 seconds. Consequently, there was almost no time for pilots to raise their aircraft undercarriage; most pilots did not bother and left them down during the air strike. After the air strike was completed and the payload dropped, the Corsair simply turned back into the landing pattern again.\n\n===The Point===\n[[File:Skull and danger sign on Peleliu.jpg|thumb|Front line warning sign on Peleliu, October 1944]]\n\nThe [[fortress]] at the end of the southern landing beaches (a.k.a. “The Point”) continued to cause heavy Marine casualties due to enfilading fire from Japanese heavy machine guns and [[Anti-tank warfare|anti-tank]] artillery across the landing beaches. Puller ordered [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] George P. Hunt, commander of K Company, [[3rd Battalion 1st Marines|3rd Battalion, 1st Marines]], to capture the position. Hunt's company approached The Point short on supplies, having lost most of its machine guns while approaching the beaches. Hunt's second [[platoon]] was pinned down for nearly a day in an [[anti-tank trench]] between [[fortification]]s. The rest of his [[company (military unit)|company]] was endangered when the Japanese cut a hole in their line, surrounding his company and leaving his right flank cut off.<ref name=Moran/>{{rp|49}}\n\nHowever, a [[rifle platoon]] began knocking out the Japanese gun positions one by one. Using [[smoke grenade]]s for cover, the platoon swept through each hole, destroying the positions with [[rifle grenade]]s and [[Close combat|close-quarters combat]]. After knocking out the six machine gun positions, the Marines faced the 47&nbsp;mm gun cave. A [[lieutenant]] blinded the 47&nbsp;mm gunner's visibility with a smoke grenade, allowing [[Corporal]] [[Henry W. Hahn]] to launch a grenade through the cave's aperture. The grenade detonated the 47&nbsp;mm's shells, forcing the cave's occupants out with their bodies lit aflame as well as their ammunition belts exploding around their waists. A Marine fire team was positioned on the flank of the cave where the former occupants were shot down.\n\nK Company had captured The Point, but Nakagawa [[counterattack]]ed. The next 30 hours saw four major counterattacks against a sole company, critically low on [[materiel|supplies]], out of water, and surrounded. The [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] soon had to resort to [[hand-to-hand combat]] to fend off the Japanese attackers. By the time [[reinforcement]]s arrived, the company had successfully repulsed all of the Japanese attacks, but had been reduced to 18 men, suffering 157 casualties during the battle for The Point.<ref name=Moran/>{{rp|50–51}} Hunt and Hahn were both awarded the [[Navy Cross]] for their actions.\n\n===Ngesebus Island===\n[[File:Digging-peleliu-l.jpg|thumb|U.S. Marine in combat at Peleliu Island, September 1944]]\nThe 5th Marines—after having secured the airfield—were sent to capture Ngesebus Island, just north of Peleliu. Ngesebus was occupied by many Japanese artillery positions, and was the site of an airfield still under construction. The tiny island was connected to Peleliu by a small causeway, but 5th Marines commander Harris opted instead to make a shore-to-shore amphibious landing, predicting the causeway to be an obvious target for the island's defenders.<ref name=Moran/>{{rp|77}}\n\nHarris coordinated a pre-landing bombardment of the island on September 28, carried out by Army {{convert|155|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} guns, naval guns, howitzers from the [[11th Marine Regiment|11th Marines]], strafing runs from VMF-114's Corsairs, and {{convert|75|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} fire from the approaching LVTs.<ref name=Moran/>{{rp|77}} Unlike the Navy's bombardment of Peleliu, Harris' assault on Ngesebus successfully killed most of the Japanese defenders. The Marines still faced opposition in the ridges and caves, but the island fell quickly, with relatively light casualties for the 5th Marines. They had suffered 15 killed and 33 wounded, and inflicted 470 casualties on the Japanese.\n\n===Bloody Nose Ridge===\n[[File:Marines wait in their foxholes - Peleliu.jpg|left|thumb|Marines waiting in their [[Defensive fighting position|fighting holes]]]]\n\nAfter capturing The Point, the 1st Marines moved north into the Umurbrogol pocket,<ref name=Moran/>{{rp|81}} named \"Bloody Nose Ridge\" by the Marines. Puller led his men in numerous assaults, but every one brought on severe casualties by the Japanese. The 1st Marines were trapped within the narrow paths between the ridges, with each ridge fortification supporting the other with deadly crossfire.\n\n[[File:Corsair attacks jap bunker on Peleliu.jpg|thumb|A Corsair drops napalm on Japanese positions atop Umurbrogol.]]\nThe Marines took increasingly high casualties as they slowly advanced through the ridges. The Japanese again showed unusual fire discipline, striking only when they could inflict maximum casualties. As casualties mounted, Japanese [[sniper]]s began to take aim at [[stretcher]] bearers, knowing that if two stretcher bearers were injured or killed, more would have to return to replace them, and the snipers could steadily pick off more and more Marines. The Japanese infiltrated the American lines at night to attack the Marines in their fighting holes. The Marines built two-man fighting holes, so one Marine could sleep while the other kept watch for infiltrators.\n\nOne particularly bloody battle on Bloody Nose came when the [[1st Battalion 1st Marines|1st Battalion, 1st Marines]]—under the command of [[Major]] [[Ray Davis (U.S. Marine)|Raymond Davis]]—attacked Hill 100. Over six days of fighting, the battalion suffered 71% casualties. [[Everett P. Pope|Captain Everett Pope]] and his company penetrated deep into the ridges, leading his remaining 90 men to seize what he thought was Hill 100. It took a day's fighting to reach what he thought was the crest of the hill, which was in fact another ridge occupied by more Japanese defenders.\n\n[[File:Resting on Peleliu Island.jpg|thumb|Marine Pfc. Douglas Lightheart (right) cradles his .30 caliber (7.62×63mm) [[M1919 Browning machine gun]] in his lap, while he and Pfc. Gerald Thursby Sr. take a cigarette break, during mopping up operations on Peleliu on 15 September 1944.]]\nTrapped at the base of the ridge, Captain Pope set up a small defense perimeter, which was attacked relentlessly by the Japanese throughout the night. The Marines soon ran out of ammunition, and had to fight the attackers with knives and fists, even resorting to throwing coral rock and empty ammunition boxes at the Japanese. Pope and his men managed to hold out until dawn came, which brought on more deadly fire. When they evacuated the position, only nine men remained. Pope later received the [[Medal of Honor]] for the action. [http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/81326046.jpg (Picture of the Peleliu Memorial dedicated on the 50th anniversary of the landing on Peleliu with Captain Pope's name)]\n\nThe Japanese eventually inflicted 70% casualties on Puller's 1st Marines, or 1,749 men.<ref name=Moran/>{{rp|66}} After six days of fighting in the ridges of Umurbrogol, [[General]] [[Roy Geiger]], commander of the III Amphibious Corps, sent elements of U.S. Army's 81st Infantry Division to Peleliu to relieve the regiment.<ref name=Moran/>{{rp|66}} The [[321st Regiment Combat Team]] landed on the western beaches of Peleliu—at the northern end of Umurbrogol mountain—on 23 September.

He then burnt his regimental colors and performed [[seppuku|ritual suicide]].<ref name=Moran/>{{rp|86}} He was posthumously promoted to [[lieutenant general]] for his valor displayed on Peleliu. On 27 November, the island was declared secure, ending the 73-day-long battle.<ref name=\"Western Pacific\"/>\n\nA [[Japanese holdout#1945-1949|Japanese lieutenant]] with twenty-six 2nd Infantry soldiers and eight 45th Guard Force sailors held out in the caves in Peleliu until April 22, 1947 and surrendered after a Japanese admiral convinced them the war was over.<ref name=Moran/>{{rp|81}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Soldiers wounded in battle of peleliu.jpg|thumb|Marines in a hospital on Guadalcanal after being wounded in the Battle of Peleliu]]\n\nThe reduction of the Japanese pocket around Umurbrogol mountain has been called the most difficult fight that the U.S. military encountered in the entire war.<ref name=Hough_94>{{cite book | url = http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USMC/USMC-M-Peleliu/USMC-M-Peleliu-5.html | title = The Seizure of Peleliu |series = USMC Historical Monograph | first = Major Frank O., USMC | last = Hough | chapter = Chapter V: A Horrible Place | page = 94 | publisher = Historical Branch, G-3 Division, Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps | accessdate = 2012-02-07 }}</ref> The 1st Marine Division was severely mauled and it remained out of action until the [[Battle of Okinawa|invasion of Okinawa]] began on April 1, 1945. In total, the 1st Marine Division suffered over 6,500 casualties during their month on Peleliu, over {{frac|1|3}} of their entire division. The 81st Infantry Division also suffered heavy losses with 3,300 casualties during their tenure on the island.\n\nPostwar statisticians calculated that it took U.S. forces over 1500 rounds of ammunition to kill each Japanese defender, and that during the course of the battle, the Americans expended 13.32 million rounds of 30-calibre, 1.52 million rounds of 45-calibre, 693,657 rounds of 50-calibre bullets, 118,262 hand grenades, and approximately 150,000 mortar rounds.<ref name= Hastings/>\n\nThe battle was controversial in the United States due to the island's lack of strategic value and the high casualty rate. The defenders lacked the means to interfere with potential US operations in the Philippines,<ref name= Hastings/> and the airfield captured on Peleliu never played a key role in subsequent operations. The high casualty rate exceeded all other amphibious operations during the Pacific War.<ref name=\"militaryhistoryonline.com\"/>\n\nInstead, the [[Ulithi Atoll]] in the [[Caroline Islands]] was used as a staging base for the invasion of Okinawa. In addition, few news reports were published about the battle because Rupertus' prediction of a \"three days\" victory motivated only six reporters to report from shore. The battle was also overshadowed by MacArthur's [[Battle of Leyte|return to the Philippines]] and the Allies' push towards [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] in [[European Theatre of World War II|Europe]].\n\nThe [[Battle of Angaur|battles for Angaur]] and Peleliu showed Americans the pattern of future Japanese island defense which would be seen again at [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] and Okinawa.<ref>{{harvnb|Morison|1958|p=46}}</ref> Naval bombardment prior to amphibious assault at Iwo Jima was only slightly more effective than at Peleliu, but at Okinawa the preliminary shelling was much improved.<ref name=Alexander95>Alexander,''Storm Landings'', p. 95.</ref> [[Frogmen]] performing [[underwater demolition]] at Iwo Jima confused the enemy by sweeping both coasts, but later alerted Japanese defenders to the exact assault beaches at Okinawa.<ref name=Alexander95/> American ground forces at Peleliu gained experience in assaulting heavily fortified positions such as they would find again at Okinawa.<ref>{{harvnb|Morison|1958|p=47}}</ref>\n\nOn the recommendation of Admiral [[William F.

In flight-simulation game ''[[War Thunder]]'', two teams of players clash to hold the southern and northern airfields. In multi-player shooter ''[[Rising Storm (video game)|Red Orchestra 2: Rising Storm]]'', a team of American troops attack the defensive Japanese team's control points.\n\nThe battle including footage and stills are featured in the fifth episode of ''[[The War (2007 film)|Ken Burns' The War]]''.\n\nThe battle features in Episodes 5, 6 and 7 of the TV mini-series ''[[The Pacific (TV miniseries)|The Pacific]]''.\n\nIn his book, 'With the Old Breed,' Eugene Bondurant Sledge described his experiences in the battle for Peleliu.\n\nIn 2015, the Japanese magazine ''[[Young Animal (magazine)|Young Animal]]'' commenced serialization of ''Peleliu: Rakuen no Guernica'' by Masao Hiratsuka and artist Kazuyoshi Takeda, telling the story of the battle in [[manga]] form.\n\nOne of the final scenes in ''Parer's War'', a 2014 Australian television film, shows the Battle of Peleliu recorded by [[Damien Parer]] with his camera at the time of his death.\n\n== Individual honors ==\n===Japan===\n====Posthumous promotions====\nFor heroism:\n* Colonel Kunio Nakagawa - lieutenant general\n* Kenjiro Murai - lieutenant general \n\n===United States===\n[[File:Kraus RE.jpg|thumb|150px|Pfc.

The attack was supported by intensive ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' bombing that reduced much of the city to rubble. The fighting degenerated into [[Urban warfare|house-to-house fighting]], and both sides poured reinforcements into the city. By mid-November 1942, the Germans had pushed the Soviet defenders back at great cost into narrow zones along the west bank of the [[Volga River]].\n\nOn 19 November 1942, the [[Red Army]] launched [[Operation Uranus]], a two-pronged attack targeting the weaker [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920-1946)|Hungarian]] armies protecting the German 6th Army's flanks.<ref>Beevor (1998: 239)</ref> The [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces on the flanks were overrun and the 6th Army was [[encirclement|cut off and surrounded]] in the Stalingrad area. [[Adolf Hitler]] ordered that the army stay in Stalingrad and make no attempt to break out; instead, attempts were made to supply the army by air and to break the encirclement from the outside. Heavy fighting continued for another two months. By the beginning of February 1943, the Axis forces in Stalingrad had exhausted their ammunition and food. The remaining units of the 6th Army surrendered.<ref name=\"Shirer1990\">{{harvnb|Shirer|1990|pp=}}</ref>{{Rp|932|date=June 2011}} The battle lasted five months, one week, and three days.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Historical background==\nBy the spring of 1942, despite the failure of [[Operation Barbarossa]] to decisively defeat the [[Soviet Union]] in a single campaign, the Wehrmacht had captured vast expanses of territory, including Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltic republics. Elsewhere, the war had been progressing well: the [[Battle of the Atlantic|U-boat offensive]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] had been very successful and [[Erwin Rommel|Rommel]] had just captured [[Tobruk#Capture of Tobruk|Tobruk]].<ref name=\"Kershaw2000\">{{harvnb|Kershaw|2000|pp=}}</ref>{{Rp|522|date=June 2011}} In the east, they had stabilized their front in a line running from [[Leningrad]] in the north to [[Rostov-on-Don|Rostov]] in the south. There were a number of [[Salient (territory)|salients]], but these were not particularly threatening. Hitler was confident that he could master the [[Red Army]] after the winter of 1942, because even though [[Army Group Centre]] (''Heeresgruppe Mitte'') had suffered heavy losses west of [[Moscow]] the previous winter, 65% of Army Group Centre's infantry had not been engaged and had been rested and re-equipped. Neither Army Group North nor Army Group South had been particularly hard pressed over the winter.<ref name=\"TaylorClark1974\">Taylor and Clark, (1974)</ref>{{Rp|144|date=June 2011}} Stalin was expecting the main thrust of the German summer attacks to be directed against Moscow again.<ref name=\"Bellamy2007\"/>{{Rp|498|date=June 2011}}\n\nWith the initial operations being very successful, the Germans decided that their summer campaign in 1942 would be directed at the southern parts of the Soviet Union. The initial objectives in the region around Stalingrad were the destruction of the industrial capacity of the city and the deployment of forces to block the [[Volga River]]. The river was a key route from the [[Caucasus]] and the [[Caspian Sea]] to central Russia. Its capture would disrupt commercial river traffic. The Germans cut the pipeline from the oilfields when they captured Rostov on 23 July. The capture of Stalingrad would make the delivery of [[Lend Lease]] supplies via the [[Persian Corridor]] much more difficult.<ref name=Shirer1990/>{{Rp|909|date=June 2011}}<ref>P.M.H.

Both sides began to attach propaganda value to the city based on it bearing the name of the leader of the Soviet Union. Hitler proclaimed that after Stalingrad's capture, its male citizens were to be killed and all women and children were to be deported because its population was \"thoroughly communistic\" and \"especially dangerous\".<ref name=\"Burleigh2001\">{{cite book|author=Michael Burleigh|title=The Third Reich: A New History|year=2001|publisher=Pan|isbn=978-0-330-48757-3|page=503}}</ref> It was assumed that the fall of the city would also firmly secure the northern and western flanks of the German armies as they advanced on [[Baku]], with the aim of securing these strategic petroleum resources for Germany.<ref name=\"Kershaw2000\"/>{{Rp|528|date=June 2011}} The expansion of objectives was a significant factor in Germany's failure at Stalingrad, caused by German overconfidence and an underestimation of Soviet reserves.<ref name=walsh2000>Walsh, Stephen.

The planned summer offensive was [[Code name|code-named]] ''Fall Blau'' ([[Case Blue]]). It was to include the German [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|6th]], [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|17th]], [[German Fourth Panzer Army|4th Panzer]] and [[1st Panzer Army|1st Panzer]] Armies. Army Group South had overrun the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] in 1941. Poised in Eastern [[Ukraine]], it was to spearhead the offensive.\n\nHitler intervened, however, ordering the [[Army Group]] to split in two. Army Group South (A), under the command of [[Wilhelm List]], was to continue advancing south towards the Caucasus as planned with the 17th Army and First Panzer Army. Army Group South (B), including [[Friedrich Paulus]]'s 6th Army and [[Hermann Hoth]]'s 4th Panzer Army, was to move east towards the Volga and Stalingrad. [[Army Group B]] was commanded initially by [[Field Marshal]] [[Fedor von Bock]] and later by General [[Maximilian von Weichs]].<ref name=Shirer1990/>{{Rp|915|date=June 2011}}\n[[File:German Summer Offensive, 7 May-23 July 1942.PNG|thumb|left|upright=1.4|The German advance to the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] between 7 May and 23 July.]]\n\nThe start of ''Case Blue'' had been planned for late May 1942. A number of German and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian]] units that were to take part in ''Blau'', however, were [[Siege of Sevastopol (1942)|besieging Sevastopol]] on the [[Crimean Peninsula]]. Delays in ending the siege pushed back the start date for ''Blau'' several times, and the city did not fall until the end of June.\n\nOperation Fridericus I by the Germans against the \"Isium bulge\", pinched off the Soviet [[Salient (military)|salient]] in the [[Second Battle of Kharkov]], and resulted in the [[envelopment]] of a large Soviet force between 17 May and 29 May.

The German offensive started well. Soviet forces offered little resistance in the vast empty steppes and started streaming eastward. Several attempts to re-establish a defensive line failed when German units [[flanking maneuver|outflanked]] them. Two major pockets were formed and destroyed: the first, northeast of Kharkov, on 2 July, and a second, around [[Millerovo]], [[Rostov Oblast]], a week later. Meanwhile, the [[Second Army (Hungary)|Hungarian 2nd Army]] and the German 4th Panzer Army had launched an [[Battle of Voronezh (1942)|assault on Voronezh]], capturing the city on 5 July.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 169-0952, Russland, bei Stalingrad, Offiziersbesprechung.jpg|thumb|Situation briefing near Stalingrad between a lieutenant officer and a junior commissioned officer]]\n\nThe initial advance of the 6th Army was so successful that Hitler intervened and ordered the 4th Panzer Army to join Army Group South (A) to the south. A massive [[traffic jam]] resulted when the 4th Panzer and the 1st Panzer both required the few roads in the area. Both armies were stopped dead while they attempted to clear the resulting mess of thousands of vehicles. The delay was long, and it is thought that it cost the advance at least one week. With the advance now slowed, Hitler changed his mind and reassigned the 4th Panzer Army back to the attack on Stalingrad.\n\nBy the end of July, the Germans had pushed the Soviets across the [[Don River, Russia|Don River]].

General Richthofen informed Manstein on 27 November of the small transport capacity of the Luftwaffe and the impossibility of supplying 300 tons a day by air. Manstein now saw the enormous technical difficulties of a supply by air of these dimensions. The next day he made a six-page situation report to the general staff. Based on the information of the expert Richthofen, he declared that contrary to the example of the pocket of Demyansk the permanent supply by air would be impossible. If only a narrow link could be established to Sixth Army, he proposed that this should be used to pull it out from the encirclement, and said that the Luftwaffe should instead of supplies deliver only enough ammunition and fuel for a breakout attempt.

From the Soviet bridgehead at Mamon, 15 divisions – supported by at least 100 tanks – attacked the Italian Cosseria and Ravenna Divisions, and although outnumbered 9 to 1, the Italians initially fought well, with the Germans praising the quality of the Italian defenders,<ref>''\"During this phase, the Germans praised the steadfastness of Italian infantry, who held out tenaciously even in isolated strongpoints, but eventually reached their breaking-point under this constant pressure. \"'' The Unknown Eastern Front: The Wehrmacht and Hitler's Foreign Soldiers, Rolf-Dieter Müller, p. 83–84, I.B.Tauris, 28 Feb 2014</ref> but on 19 December, with the Italian lines disintegrating, ARMIR headquarters ordered the battered divisions to withdraw to new lines.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Paoletti|first=Ciro|title=A Military History of Italy|publisher=Praeger Security International|location=Westport, CT|year=2008|page=177| isbn=0-275-98505-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Uz8eiwzEMHQC&pg=PA182&dq=Ariete+tanks+fight!#PPA177,M1|accessdate=4 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe fighting forced a total revaluation of the German situation. The attempt to break through to Stalingrad was abandoned and Army Group A was ordered to pull back from the Caucasus. The 6th Army now was beyond all hope of German relief. While a motorised breakout might have been possible in the first few weeks, the 6th Army now had insufficient fuel and the German soldiers would have faced great difficulty breaking through the Soviet lines on foot in harsh winter conditions.

Nevertheless, they continued to resist, in part because they believed the Soviets would execute any who surrendered. In particular, the so-called ''[[Hiwi (volunteer)|HiWis]]'', Soviet citizens fighting for the Germans, had no illusions about their fate if captured. The Soviets were initially surprised by the number of Germans they had trapped, and had to reinforce their encircling troops. Bloody [[urban warfare]] began again in Stalingrad, but this time it was the Germans who were pushed back to the banks of the Volga. The Germans adopted a simple defense of fixing wire nets over all windows to protect themselves from grenades. The Soviets responded by fixing fish hooks to the grenades so they stuck to the nets when thrown.\n\nThe Germans had no usable tanks in the city, and those that still functioned could, at best, be used as makeshift pillboxes. The Soviets did not bother employing tanks in areas where the urban destruction restricted their mobility. A low-level Soviet envoy party (comprising Major Aleksandr Smyslov, Captain [[Nikolay Dyatlenko]] and a trumpeter) carried an offer to Paulus: if he surrendered within 24 hours, he would receive a guarantee of safety for all prisoners, medical care for the sick and wounded, prisoners being allowed to keep their personal belongings, \"normal\" food rations, and [[repatriation]] to any country they wished after the war; but Paulus – ordered not to surrender by Hitler – did not respond.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|1995|pp=}}</ref>{{Rp|283|date=June 2011}}\n\nOn 22 January, Paulus requested that he be granted permission to surrender.

Brown University historian [[Omer Bartov]] claims they were motivated by National Socialism. He studied 11,237 letters sent by soldiers inside of Stalingrad between 20 December 1942 and 16 January 1943 to their families in Germany.

British war correspondent [[Alexander Werth]] described the following scene in his ''Russia at War'' book, based on a first-hand account of his visit to Stalingrad from 3–5 February 1943,\n\n{{quote|We [...] went into the yard of the large burnt out building of the Red Army House; and here one realized particularly clearly what the last days of Stalingrad had been to so many of the Germans. In the porch lay the skeleton of a horse, with only a few scraps of meat still clinging to its ribs. Then we came into the yard. Here lay more more horses' skeletons, and to the right, there was an enormous horrible cesspool – fortunately, frozen solid. And then, suddenly, at the far end of the yard I caught sight of a human figure. He had been crouching over another cesspool, and now, noticing us, he was hastily pulling up his pants, and then he slunk away into the door of the basement. But as he passed, I caught a glimpse of the wretch's face – with its mixture of suffering and idiot-like incomprehension. For a moment, I wished that the whole of Germany were there to see it. The man was probably already dying. In that basement [...] there were still two hundred Germans—dying of hunger and frostbite. \"We haven't had time to deal with them yet,\" one of the Russians said. \"They'll be taken away tomorrow, I suppose.\" And, at the far end of the yard, besides the other cesspool, behind a low stone wall, the yellow corpses of skinny Germans were piled up – men who had died in that basement—about a dozen wax-like dummies. We did not go into the basement itself – what was the use? There was nothing we could do for them.<ref>Alexander Werth, Russia at War 1941–1945, New York, E. P.

Germany's defeat shattered its reputation for invincibility and dealt a devastating blow to German morale. On 30 January 1943, the tenth anniversary of his coming to power, Hitler chose not to speak. [[Joseph Goebbels]] read the text of his speech for him on the radio. The speech contained an oblique reference to the battle, which suggested that Germany was now in a defensive war. The public mood was sullen, depressed, fearful, and war-weary. Germany was looking in the face of defeat.<ref>P.M.H.

A [[Army of the North (France)|French army]] under the command of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was defeated by two of the armies of the [[Seventh Coalition]]: a [[British Army|British]]-led Allied army under the command of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], and a [[Prussia]]n army under the command of [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher|Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, Prince of Wahlstatt]].\n\nUpon Napoleon's return to power in March 1815, many states that had opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition, and began to mobilize armies. Wellington and Blücher's armies were [[canton (military)|cantoned]] close to the north-eastern border of France. Napoleon chose to attack them separately in the hope of destroying them before they could join in a co-ordinated invasion of France with other members of the coalition. Napoleon successfully attacked the bulk of the Prussian army at the [[Battle of Ligny]] with his main force, while at the same time a portion of the French army attacked an Allied army at the [[Battle of Quatre Bras]]. Despite holding his ground at Quatre Bras, the defeat of the Prussians forced Wellington to withdraw to [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]]. Napoleon sent a third of his forces to pursue the Prussians, who had [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|withdrawn parallel to Wellington]]. This resulted in the separate and simultaneous [[Battle of Wavre]] with the Prussian rear-guard.\n\nUpon learning that the Prussian army was able to support him, Wellington decided to offer battle on the [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Mont-Saint-Jean]] [[escarpment]], across the Brussels road. Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon, aided by the progressively arriving Prussians. In the evening Napoleon committed his last reserves to a desperate final attack, which was narrowly beaten back. With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, Wellington's Anglo-allied army counter-attacked in the centre, and the French army was routed.\n\nWaterloo was the decisive engagement of the [[Waterloo Campaign]] and Napoleon's last. According to Wellington, the battle was \"the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life\".<ref>[[q:Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wikiquote:Wellington]] citing ''Creevey Papers'', ch. x, p. 236</ref> [[Abdication of Napoleon, 1815|Napoleon abdicated]] four days later, and on 7 July coalition forces entered Paris. The defeat at Waterloo ended Napoleon's rule as [[Emperor of the French]], and marked the end of his [[Hundred Days]] return from exile. This ended the [[First French Empire]], and set a chronological milestone between serial European wars and decades of relative peace.\n\nThe battlefield is located in the municipalities of [[Braine-l'Alleud]] and [[Lasne]],{{sfn|Marcelis|2015}} about {{convert|15|km|mi}} south of [[Brussels]], and about {{convert|2|km|mi}} from the town of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]]. The site of the battlefield today is dominated by a large monument, the [[Lion's Mound]]. As this mound was constructed from earth taken from the battlefield itself, the contemporary topography of the battlefield near the mound has not been preserved.\n\n==Prelude==\n{{Main article|Waterloo Campaign}}\n[[File:Strategic Situation of Western Europe 1815.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The strategic situation in Western Europe in 1815: 250,000 Frenchmen faced a coalition of about 850,000 soldiers on four [[Front (military)|fronts]].

Crucially, this would have bought him time to recruit and train more men before turning his armies against the Austrians and Russians.\n\nAn additional consideration for Napoleon was that a French victory might cause French speaking sympathisers in Belgium to launch a friendly revolution. Also, coalition troops in Belgium were largely second-line, as many units were of dubious quality and loyalty, and most of the British veterans of the [[Peninsular War]] had been sent to North America to fight in the [[War of 1812]].{{sfn|Chandler|1966|pp=1016, 1017, 1093}}\n\n[[File:Waterloo Campaign map-alt3.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|left|A map of the Waterloo campaign]]\n[[File:Napoleon crop.jpg|thumb|upright|The resurgent [[Napoleon|Napoleon's]] strategy was to isolate the Allied and Prussian armies and [[Defeat in detail|annihilate each one separately]].]] [[File:Lord Arthur Wellesley the Duke of Wellington.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|1st Duke of Wellington]], commander of the Anglo-allied army]]\n\nWellington's initial dispositions were intended to counter the threat of Napoleon enveloping the Coalition armies by moving through [[Mons]] to the south-west of Brussels.{{sfn|Siborne<!--W-->|1895|p=82}} This would have pushed Wellington closer to Blücher, but may have cut Wellington's communications with his base at [[Ostend]]. In order to delay Wellington's deployment, Napoleon spread false intelligence which suggested that Wellington's supply chain from the channel ports would be cut.{{sfn|Hofschröer|2005|pp=136–160}}\n\nBy June, Napoleon had raised a total army strength of about 300,000 men. The force at his disposal at Waterloo was less than one third that size, but the rank and file were nearly all loyal and experienced soldiers.{{sfn|Herold|1967|pp= 53, 58, 110}} Napoleon divided his army into a left wing commanded by [[Michel Ney|Marshal Ney]], a right wing commanded by [[Emmanuel, marquis de Grouchy|Marshal Grouchy]] and a reserve under his command (although all three elements remained close enough to support one another). Crossing the frontier near [[Charleroi]] before dawn on 15 June, the French [[Waterloo Campaign: Start of hostilities (15 June)|rapidly overran Coalition outposts]], securing Napoleon's \"central position\" between Wellington's and Blücher's armies. He hoped this would prevent them from combining, and he would be able to destroy first the Prussian's army, then Wellington's.\n\nOnly very late on the night of 15 June was Wellington certain that the Charleroi attack was the main French thrust. In the early hours of 16 June, at the [[Duchess of Richmond's ball]] in Brussels, he received a dispatch from the [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] and was shocked by the speed of Napoleon's advance. He hastily ordered his army to concentrate on [[Quatre Bras]], where the Prince of Orange, with the brigade of [[Bernhard Carl of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar]], was holding a tenuous position against the soldiers of Ney's left wing.{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=508}}\n\nNey's orders were to secure the crossroads of Quatre Bras, so that he could later swing east and reinforce Napoleon if necessary. Ney found the crossroads of [[Battle of Quatre Bras|Quatre Bras]] lightly held by the Prince of Orange, who repelled Ney's initial attacks but was gradually driven back by overwhelming numbers of French troops. First reinforcements, and then Wellington arrived. He took command and drove Ney back, securing the crossroads by early evening, too late to send help to the Prussians, who had already been defeated.\n\nMeanwhile on 16 June, Napoleon attacked and defeated Blücher's Prussians at the [[Battle of Ligny]] using part of the reserve and the right wing of his army. The Prussian centre gave way under heavy French assaults, but the flanks held their ground. [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|The Prussian retreat from Ligny]] went uninterrupted and seemingly unnoticed by the French. The bulk of their rearguard units held their positions until about midnight, and some elements did not move out until the following morning, ignored by the French.{{sfn|Chesney|1874|p=144}}\n\nCrucially, the Prussians did not retreat to the east, along their own lines of communication. Instead, they, too, fell back northwards—parallel to Wellington's line of march, still within supporting distance and in communication with him throughout. The Prussians rallied on [[Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von Bülow|Bülow's]] IV Corps, which had not been engaged at Ligny and was in a strong position south of [[Wavre]].{{sfn|Chesney|1874|pp=144–145}}\n\nWith the Prussian retreat from Ligny, Wellington's position at Quatre Bras was untenable. The next day he withdrew northwards, to a defensive position he had [[reconnaissance|reconnoitred]] the previous year—the low [[ridge]] of Mont-Saint-Jean, south of the village of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]] and the [[Sonian Forest]].{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=527}}\n\nNapoleon, with the reserves, made a late start on 17 June and joined Ney at Quatre Bras at 13:00 to attack Wellington's army but found the position empty. The French pursued Wellington's retreating army to Waterloo; however, due to bad weather, mud and the head start that Napoleon's tardy advance had allowed Wellington, apart from a cavalry [[action at Genappe]], there was no substantial engagement.\n\nBefore leaving Ligny, Napoleon had ordered Grouchy, who commanded the right wing, to [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|follow up the retreating Prussians]] with 33,000 men. A late start, uncertainty about the direction the Prussians had taken, and the vagueness of the orders given to him, meant that Grouchy was too late to prevent the Prussian army reaching Wavre, from where it could march to support Wellington. More importantly, the heavily outnumbered Prussian rear-guard was able to use the River Dyle to enable a savage and prolonged action to delay Grouchy.\n\nAs the 17th of June drew to a close, Wellington's army had arrived at its position at Waterloo, with the main body of Napoleon's army following. Blücher's army was gathering in and around Wavre, around {{convert|8|mi|km}} to the east of the city. Early on the morning of the 18th, Wellington received an assurance from Blücher that the Prussian army would support him. He decided to hold his ground and give battle.\n\n==Armies==\n{{Main article|Order of Battle of the Waterloo Campaign}}\nThree armies were involved in the battle: Napoleon's ''Armée du Nord'', a multinational army under Wellington, and a Prussian army under Blücher.\n{{multiple image\n|align = right\n|direction = horizontal\n|image1 = Marechal Ney.jpg\n|width1 = 180\n|alt1 =\n|image2 = YoungwilliamII.jpg\n|width2 = 180\n|alt2 =\n|footer = ''Left,'' Marshal [[Michel Ney]], who exercised tactical control of the greater part of the French forces for most of the battle.

His troops were mainly veterans with considerable experience and a fierce devotion to their Emperor.{{sfn|Glover|2014|page=30}} The cavalry in particular was both numerous and formidable, and included fourteen regiments of armoured [[heavy cavalry]], and seven of highly versatile [[lancers]] who were armed with lances, sabres and firearms.\n\nHowever as the army took shape, French officers were allocated to units as they presented themselves for duty, so that many units were commanded by officers the soldiers didn't know, and often didn't trust. Crucially, some of these officers had little experience in working together as a unified force, so that support for other units was often not given.\n\nThe French army was forced to march through rain and black coal-dust mud to reach Waterloo, and then to contend with mud and rain as it slept in the open. Little food was available for the soldiers, but nevertheless the veteran French soldiers were fiercely loyal to Napoleon.\n\nWellington later said that he had \"an infamous army, very weak and ill-equipped, and a very inexperienced Staff\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=485}} His troops consisted of 67,000 men: 50,000 infantry, 11,000 cavalry, and 6,000 artillery with 150 guns. Of these, 25,000 were British, with another 6,000 from the [[King's German Legion]] (KGL). All of the [[British Army]] troops were regular soldiers, but only 7,000 of them were [[Peninsular War]] veterans.{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=484}} In addition, there were 17,000 Dutch and Belgian troops, 11,000 from [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]], 6,000 from [[Brunswick-Lüneburg#Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Brunswick]], and 3,000 from [[Nassau (duchy)|Nassau]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=75–76}}\n\nMany of the troops in the Coalition armies were inexperienced.{{efn|Captain [[Cavalié Mercer]] [[Royal Horse Artillery|RHA]], thought the Brunswickers \"...perfect children. None of the privates, perhaps were over eighteen years of age\" {{Harv|Mercer|1891|p=218}}.}}{{efn|On 13 June, the commandant at [[Ath]] requested powder and cartridges as members of a Hanoverian reserve regiment there had never yet fired a shot {{Harv|Longford|1971|p=486}}.}} The Dutch army had been re-established in 1815, following the earlier defeat of Napoleon. With the exception of the British and some from Hanover and Brunswick who had fought with the British army in Spain, many of the professional soldiers in the Coalition armies had spent some of their time in the French army or in armies allied to the Napoleonic regime. The historian Barbero states that in this heterogeneous army the difference between British and ''foreign'' troops did not prove significant under fire.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|p=19}}\n\nWellington was also acutely short of heavy cavalry, having only seven British and three Dutch regiments. The [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] imposed many of his staff officers on Wellington, including his second-in-command the [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Earl of Uxbridge]]. Uxbridge commanded the cavalry and had [[Blank cheque|carte blanche]] from Wellington to commit these forces at his discretion. Wellington stationed a further 17,000 troops at [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]], {{convert|8|mi|km}} away to the west. They were not recalled to participate in the battle but were to serve as a fallback position should the battle be lost. They were mostly composed of Dutch troops under [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange's]] younger brother [[Prince Frederick of the Netherlands]]. They were placed as a guard against any possible wide flanking movement by the French forces, and also to act as a rearguard if Wellington was forced to retreat towards Antwerp and the coast.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=239–240}}{{efn|The straight-line distance from Halle to Braine-l'Alleud, Wellington's far right flank is nearly the same as the straight-line distance from Wavre to [[Frichermont]], Wellington's far left flank, around {{convert|8|mi|km}}.}}\n\nThe Prussian army was in the throes of reorganisation. In 1815, the former Reserve regiments, Legions, and ''Freikorps'' volunteer formations from the wars of 1813–1814 were in the process of being absorbed into the line, along with many ''[[Landwehr]]'' (militia) regiments. The ''Landwehr'' were mostly untrained and unequipped when they arrived in Belgium. The Prussian cavalry were in a similar state.{{sfn|Hofschröer|2005|p=59}} Its artillery was also reorganising and did not give its best performance&nbsp;– guns and equipment continued to arrive during and after the battle.{{sfn|Hofschröer|2005|pp=60–62}}\n\nOffsetting these handicaps, the Prussian Army had excellent and professional leadership in its [[German General Staff|General Staff]] organisation. These officers came from four schools developed for this purpose and thus worked to a common standard of training. This system was in marked contrast to the conflicting, vague orders issued by the French army. This staff system ensured that before Ligny, three-quarters of the Prussian army concentrated for battle with 24 hours notice.{{sfn|Hofschröer|2005|pp=60–62}}\n\nAfter Ligny, the Prussian army, although defeated, was able to realign its supply train, reorganise itself, and intervene decisively on the Waterloo battlefield within 48 hours.{{sfn|Hofschröer|2005|pp=60–62}} Two and a half Prussian army corps, or 48,000 men, were engaged at Waterloo; two brigades under Bülow, commander of IV Corps, attacked [[Georges Mouton|Lobau]] at 16:30, while [[Hans Ernst Karl von Zieten|Zieten's]] I Corps and parts of [[Pirch I|Pirch I's]] II Corps engaged at about 18:00.\n\n==Battlefield==\n{{further information|List of Waterloo Battlefield locations}}\n[[File:Belgium-6773 - Battlefield View (14152126362).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A view of the battlefield from the Lion's mound. On the top right are the buildings of [[La Haye Sainte]].]]\nThe Waterloo position was a strong one. It consisted of a long ridge running east-west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels. Along the crest of the ridge ran the [[Ohain, Belgium|Ohain]] road, a deep [[sunken lane]]. Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was [[Waterloo Elm|a large elm tree]] that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post for much of the day. Wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind the crest of the ridge following the Ohain road.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78–79}}\n\nUsing the [[Reverse slope defence|reverse slope]], as he had many times previously, Wellington concealed his strength from the French, with the exception of his [[skirmisher]]s and artillery.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78–79}} The length of front of the battlefield was also relatively short at {{convert|2.5|mi|km}}. This allowed Wellington to draw up his forces in depth, which he did in the centre and on the right, all the way towards the village of [[Braine-l'Alleud]], in the expectation that the Prussians would reinforce his left during the day.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=80}}\n\n[[File:Waterloo.1816.02.jpg|thumb|right|An 1816 map showing the local geography, with Waterloo defending the approach to [[Brussels]]]]\nIn front of the ridge, there were three positions that could be fortified. On the extreme right were the château, garden, and orchard of [[Hougoumont (farmhouse)|Hougoumont]]. This was a large and well-built country house, initially hidden in trees. The house faced north along a sunken, covered lane (usually described by the British as \"the hollow-way\") along which it could be supplied. On the extreme left was the hamlet of [[Papelotte]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}}\n\nBoth Hougoumont and Papelotte were fortified and garrisoned, and thus anchored Wellington's [[Flanking maneuver|flanks]] securely. Papelotte also commanded the road to Wavre that the Prussians would use to send reinforcements to Wellington's position. On the western side of the main road, and in front of the rest of Wellington's line, was the farmhouse and orchard of [[La Haye Sainte]], which was garrisoned with 400 light infantry of the [[King's German Legion]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}} On the opposite side of the road was a disused sand quarry, where the [[95th Rifles]] were posted as sharpshooters.{{sfn|Parry|1900|p=58}}\n\nWellington's forces positioning presented a formidable challenge to any attacking force. Any attempt to turn Wellington's right would entail taking the entrenched Hougoumont position. Any attack on his right centre would mean the attackers would have to march between [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilading fire]] from Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte. On the left, any attack would also be enfiladed by fire from La Haye Sainte and its adjoining sandpit, and any attempt at turning the left flank would entail fighting through the lanes and hedgerows surrounding Papelotte and the [[List of Waterloo Battlefield locations#Eastern end of the line of battle|other garrisoned buildings]] on that flank, and some very wet ground in the Smohain [[defile (geography)|defile]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=141, 235}}\n\nThe French army formed on the slopes of another ridge to the south. Napoleon could not see Wellington's positions, so he drew his forces up symmetrically about the Brussels road. On the right was I Corps under [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon|d'Erlon]] with 16,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry, plus a cavalry reserve of 4,700. On the left was II Corps under [[Honoré Charles Reille|Reille]] with 13,000 infantry, and 1,300 cavalry, and a cavalry reserve of 4,600. In the centre about the road south of the inn ''[[La Belle Alliance]]'' were a reserve including Lobau's VI Corps with 6,000 men, the 13,000 infantry of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]], and a cavalry reserve of 2,000.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=83–85}}\n\nIn the right rear of the French position was the substantial village of [[Plancenoit]], and at the extreme right, the ''Bois de Paris'' wood. Napoleon initially commanded the battle from Rossomme farm, where he could see the entire battlefield, but moved to a position near ''La Belle Alliance'' early in the afternoon. Command on the battlefield (which was largely hidden from his view) was delegated to Ney.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=91}}\n\n[[File:Panorama waterloo v2.jpg|thumb|upright=4|center|A panorama of the Waterloo battlefield in 2012]]\n\n==Battle==\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Blücher (nach Gebauer).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher]], who had led one of the coalition armies defeating Napoleon at the [[Battle of Leipzig]], commanded the Prussian army]]\nWellington rose at around 02:00 or 03:00 on 18 June, and wrote letters until dawn. He had earlier written to Blücher confirming that he would give battle at Mont-Saint-Jean if Blücher could provide him with at least one corps; otherwise he would retreat towards Brussels. At a late-night council, Blücher's chief of staff, [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau]], had been distrustful of Wellington's strategy, but Blücher persuaded him that they should march to join Wellington's army. In the morning Wellington duly received a reply from Blücher, promising to support him with three corps.{{sfn|Longford|1971|pp=535–536}}\n\nFrom 06:00 Wellington was in the field supervising the deployment of his forces. At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under Bülow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo as it was in the best shape, not having been involved in the [[Battle of Ligny]]. Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army from the battlefield of Ligny. They had been posted farthest away from the battlefield, and progress was very slow. The roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and Bülow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move 88&nbsp;artillery pieces. Matters were not helped when a fire broke out in Wavre, blocking several streets along Bülow's intended route. As a result, the last part of the corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo. Bülow's men were followed to Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=141}}\n\nNapoleon breakfasted off silver plate at ''Le Caillou'', the house where he had spent the night. When [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Soult]] suggested that Grouchy should be recalled to join the main force, Napoleon said, \"Just because you have all been beaten by Wellington, you think he's a good general. I tell you Wellington is a bad general, the English are bad troops, and this affair is nothing more than eating breakfast\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=547}}\n\nNapoleon's seemingly dismissive remark may have been strategic, given his maxim \"in war, morale is everything\". He had acted similarly in the past, and on the morning of the battle of Waterloo may have been responding to the pessimism and objections of his chief of staff and senior generals.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|pp=163–166}}\n\nLater on, being told by his brother, [[Jérôme Bonaparte|Jerome]], of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British officers at lunch at the 'King of Spain' inn in Genappe that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would need at least two days to recover and would be dealt with by Grouchy.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=73}} Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at ''Le Caillou'' had no information about the alarming proximity of the Prussians and did not suspect that Blücher's men would start erupting onto the field of battle in great numbers just five hours later.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=xxxii}}\n\n[[File:Napoleon.Waterloo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Battle of Mont-Saint-Jean]]]]\nNapoleon had delayed the start of the battle owing to the sodden ground, which would have made manoeuvring cavalry and artillery difficult. In addition, many of his forces had [[bivouac shelter|bivouacked]] well to the south of ''La Belle Alliance''. At 10:00, in response to a dispatch he had received from Grouchy six hours earlier, he sent a reply telling Grouchy to \"head for Wavre [to Grouchy's north] in order to draw near to us [to the west of Grouchy]\" and then \"push before him\" the Prussians to arrive at Waterloo \"as soon as possible\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=548}}\n\nAt 11:00, Napoleon drafted his general order: Reille's Corps on the left and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more forward position on the ridge.{{sfn|Bonaparte|1869|pp=292–293}} To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves,{{sfn|Fletcher|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=US-QQxjHnn8C&pg=PA20 20]}} since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A ''[[Grand Battery|grande batterie]]'' of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up his line from east to west. In his memoirs, Napoleon wrote that his intention was to separate Wellington's army from the Prussians and drive it back towards the sea.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=95–98}}\n\n===Hougoumont===\n{{Main article|Hougoumont}}\n\n[[File:Castle of Hougoumont during the Battle of Waterloo.jpg|thumb|left|Fighting at the Hougoumont farm]]\nThe historian Andrew Roberts notes that \"It is a curious fact about the Battle of Waterloo that no one is absolutely certain when it actually began\".{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=55}} Wellington recorded in his dispatches that at \"about ten o'clock [Napoleon] commenced a furious attack upon our post at Hougoumont\".{{sfn|Wellesley|1815|loc=''To Earl Bathurst.

The Duke of Wellington puts it at 10:00. General Alava says half-past eleven, Napoleon and Drouet say noon, and Ney 13:00. Lord Hill may be credited with having settled this minute question of fact. He took two watches with him into the fight, one a stop-watch, and he marked with it the sound of the first shot fired, and this evidence is now accepted as proving that the first flash of red flame which marked the opening of the world-shaking tragedy of Waterloo took place at exactly ten minutes to twelve\" {{Harv|Fitchett|2006|loc=Chapter: King-making Waterloo}}. \"...watches had to be set by solar time, this meant that it was rare for two watches to agree...

Assuming an officer had set his watch at noon and then meticulously wound it twice a day but not reset it during the approach march, by the time the two corps reached the vicinity of Waterloo, the I Corps officer's watch would have read 12:40 p.m. at a time when the IV Corps officer's read 11:20 a.m., and it was noon at Waterloo. This is an extreme example, and unlikely to have actually been the case, but it demonstrates the problem quite well\" {{harv|Nofi|1998|p=182}}.}} The house and its immediate environs were defended by four light companies of [[Foot Guards|Guards]], and the wood and park by Hanoverian ''[[Jäger (military)|Jäger]]'' and the 1/2nd Nassau.{{efn|That is, the 1st battalion of the 2nd Regiment.

As the British guns were distracted by a duel with French artillery, a second attack by Soye's brigade and what had been Bauduin's succeeded in reaching the north gate of the house. Sous-Lieutenant Legros, a French officer, broke the gate open with an axe, and some French troops managed to enter the courtyard.{{sfn|Thiers|1862|p=215}} The [[Coldstream Guards]] and [[Scots Guards|the Scots Guards]] arrived to support the defence. There was a fierce melee, and the British managed to close the gate on the French troops streaming in. The Frenchmen trapped in the courtyard were all killed. Only a young drummer boy was spared.\n\n[[File:800px-North gate Hougoumont.jpg|thumb|Gate on the north side assaulted by the ''1st Légère'' who were led by ''[[sous-lieutenant]]'' Legros{{sfn|Lamar|2000|p=119}}]]\nFighting continued around Hougoumont all afternoon.

The King's German Legion resolutely defended the farmhouse. Each time the French tried to scale the walls the outnumbered Germans somehow held them off. The Prince of Orange saw that La Haye Sainte had been cut off and tried to reinforce it by sending forward the Hanoverian Lüneberg Battalion in line. Cuirassiers concealed in a fold in the ground caught and destroyed it in minutes and then rode on past La Haye Sainte, almost to the crest of the ridge, where they covered d'Erlon's left flank as his attack developed.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=289–293}}\n\nAt about 13:30, d'Erlon started to advance his three other divisions, some 14,000&nbsp;men over a front of about {{convert|1,000|m|yd|abbr=off}}, against Wellington's left wing.

The second line consisted of British and Hanoverian troops under [[Sir Thomas Picton]], who were lying down in dead ground behind the ridge. All had suffered badly at Quatre Bras.

It was lined on both sides by thick hedges, with [[Willem Frederik van Bylandt|Bylandt's]] brigade just across the road while the British brigades had been lying down some 100 yards back from the road, Pack's to Bylandt's left and Kempt's to Bylandt's right. Kempt's 1,900 men were engaged by Bourgeois' brigade of 1,900 men of Quiot's division. In the centre, [[François-Xavier Donzelot|Donzelot's]] division had pushed back Bylandt's brigade. On the right of the French advance was Marcognet's division led by Grenier's brigade consisting of the ''45e Régiment de Ligne'' and followed by the ''25e Régiment de Ligne'', somewhat less than 2,000 men, and behind them, Nogue's brigade of the ''21e'' and ''45e'' regiments. Opposing them on the other side of the road was [[Denis Pack|Pack's]] 9th Brigade consisting of three Scottish regiments: the [[Royal Scots]], the 42nd [[Black Watch]], the 92nd Gordons and the [[44th Foot]] totaling something over 2,000 men. A very even fight between British and French infantry was about to occur.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|pp=134–138}}\n\nThe French advance drove in the British skirmishers and reached the sunken road. As they did so, Pack's men stood up, formed into a four deep line formation for fear of the French cavalry, advanced, and opened fire. However, a firefight had been anticipated and the French infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation. Now, fully deployed into line, they returned fire and successfully pressed the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre, the line in front of d'Erlon's right started to crumble. Picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way under the pressure of numbers.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=296–297}} Pack's regiments, all four ranks deep, advanced to attack the French in the road but faltered and began to fire on the French instead of charging. The 42nd Black Watch halted at the hedge and the resulting fire-fight drove back the British 92nd Foot while the leading French ''45e Ligne'' burst through the hedge cheering.

He mistook the movement of casualties to the rear for the beginnings of a retreat, and sought to exploit it. Following the defeat of d'Erlon's Corps, Ney had few infantry reserves left, as most of the infantry had been committed either to the futile Hougoumont attack or to the defence of the French right. Ney therefore tried to break Wellington's centre with cavalry alone.{{sfn|Siborne<!--W-->|1895|pp=443–449}}\nInitially [[Édouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud|Milhaud's]] reserve cavalry corps of cuirassiers and [[Charles, comte Lefebvre-Desnouettes|Lefebvre-Desnoëttes']] light cavalry division of the Imperial Guard, some 4,800&nbsp;sabres, were committed. When these were repulsed, [[François Étienne de Kellermann|Kellermann's]] heavy cavalry corps and [[Claude-Étienne Guyot|Guyot's]] heavy cavalry of the Guard were added to the massed assault, a total of around 9,000&nbsp;cavalry in 67&nbsp;squadrons.{{sfn|Adkin|2001|p=356}} When Napoleon saw the charge he said it was an hour too soon.{{sfn|Esposito|Elting|1999|p=354, Map 166}}\n\n[[File:French cuirassiers vs Nassauers.jpg|thumb|''French [[Cuirassier]]s'', by Louis Dumoulin]]\n\nWellington's infantry responded by forming [[infantry square|squares]] (hollow box-formations four ranks deep). Squares were much smaller than usually depicted in paintings of the battle – a 500-man battalion square would have been no more than {{convert|60|ft|m}} in length on a side. Squares that stood their ground were deadly to cavalry, as cavalry could not engage with soldiers behind a hedge of bayonets, but were themselves vulnerable to fire from the squares. Horses would not charge a square, nor could they be outflanked, but they were vulnerable to artillery or infantry. Wellington ordered his artillery crews to take shelter within the squares as the cavalry approached, and to return to their guns and resume fire as they retreated.{{sfn|Siborne<!--W-->|1895|pp=444, 447}}{{sfn|Adkin|2001|pp=273, 414}}\n\nWitnesses in the British infantry recorded as many as 12&nbsp;assaults, though this probably includes successive waves of the same general attack; the number of general assaults was undoubtedly far fewer. Kellermann, recognising the futility of the attacks, tried to reserve the elite ''[[Carabiniers-à-Cheval|carabinier]]'' brigade from joining in, but eventually Ney spotted them and insisted on their involvement.{{sfn|Adkin|2001|p=359}}\n\nA British eyewitness of the first French cavalry attack, an officer in the Foot Guards, recorded his impressions very lucidly and somewhat poetically:\n\n{{quote|About four p.m., the enemy's artillery in front of us ceased firing all of a sudden, and we saw large masses of cavalry advance: not a man present who survived could have forgotten in after life the awful grandeur of that charge. You discovered at a distance what appeared to be an overwhelming, long moving line, which, ever advancing, glittered like a stormy wave of the sea when it catches the sunlight. On they came until they got near enough, whilst the very earth seemed to vibrate beneath the thundering tramp of the mounted host. One might suppose that nothing could have resisted the shock of this terrible moving mass. They were the famous cuirassiers, almost all old soldiers, who had distinguished themselves on most of the battlefields of Europe. In an almost incredibly short period they were within twenty yards of us, shouting ''\"Vive l'Empereur!\"'' The word of command, \"Prepare to receive cavalry\", had been given, every man in the front ranks knelt, and a wall bristling with steel, held together by steady hands, presented itself to the infuriated cuirassiers.|Captain Rees Howell Gronow, Foot Guards.{{sfn|Gronow|1862|loc=''The Duke of Wellington in our square''}} }}\n\n[[File:Artillery in Battle of Waterloo by Jones.jpg|thumb|\"The artillery officers had the range so accurately, that every shot and shell fell into the very centre of their masses\" (Original inscription and drawing after [[George Jones (painter)|George Jones]]).]]\n\nIn essence this type of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on psychological shock for effect.{{sfn|Weller|1992|pp=211,212}} Close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate; at Waterloo, however, co-operation between the French cavalry and artillery was not impressive. The French artillery did not get close enough to the Anglo-allied infantry in sufficient numbers to be decisive.{{sfn|Adkin|2001|pp=252,361}} Artillery fire between charges did produce mounting casualties, but most of this fire was at relatively long range and was often indirect, at targets beyond the ridge. If infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations, and were not panicked, cavalry on their own could do very little damage to them. The French cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares, the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive countercharges of Wellington's light cavalry regiments, the Dutch heavy cavalry brigade, and the remaining effectives of the Household Cavalry. At least one artillery officer disobeyed Wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges. [[Cavalié Mercer|Captain Mercer]], who commanded [[G Parachute Battery (Mercer's Troop) Royal Horse Artillery|'G' Troop]], [[Royal Horse Artillery]], thought the Brunswick troops on either side of him so shaky that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout, to great effect.{{sfn|Mercer|1870a|pp=313–315}}{{efn|This qualification may have been self-serving on Mercer's part. Wellington himself sought refuge in the \"shaky\" Brunswick squares at the time and observed what he interpreted as acts of cowardice by British artillerymen, who \"...&nbsp;ran off the field entirely, taking with them limbers, ammunition, and everything&nbsp;...\" as he wrote in a letter of 21 December 1815 to the Master-General of the Ordnance, Lord Mulgrave. The incident even justified the denial of pensions to members of the Artillery Corps in his view. So, where Mercer claimed heroism, Wellington saw the opposite.

Wellington's cavalry, except for Sir John Vandeleur's and Sir Hussey Vivian's brigades on the far left, had all been committed to the fight, and had taken significant losses.

French skirmishers appeared around the building and fired on the British command as it struggled to get away through the hedgerow along the road.

When the Nassauers attempted to attack the battery they were ridden down by a squadron of cuirassiers .

Mercer later recalled, \"The rapidity and precision of this fire was quite appaling. Every shot almost took effect, and I certainly expected we should all be annihilated. ...

Napoleon sent Ney's senior ADC Colonel Crabbé to order Ney to adjust, but Crabbé was unable to get there in time.\n\nOther troops rallied to support the advance of the Guard. On the left infantry from Reille's corps that was not engaged with Hougoumont and cavalry advanced. On the right all the now rallied elements of D'Érlon's corps once again ascended the ridge and engaged the allied line. Of these, Pégot's brigade broke into skirmish order and moved north and west of La Haye Sainte and provided fire support to Ney, once again unhorsed, and Friant's 1st/3rd Grenadiers. The Guards first received fire from some Brunswick battalions, but the return fire of the grenadiers forced them to retire. Next, Colin Halket's brigade front line consisting of the 30th Foot and 73rd traded fire but they were driven back in confusion into the 33rd and 69th regiments, Halket was shot in the face and seriously wounded and the whole brigade retreated in a mob. Other allied troops began to give way as well. A counterattack by the Nassauers and the remains of Kielmansegge's brigade from the allied second line, led by the Prince of Orange, was also thrown back and the Prince of Orange was seriously wounded.

The left flank of their square now came under fire from a heavy formation of British skirmishers, which the chasseurs drove back. But the skirmishers were replaced by the [[52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot|52nd Light Infantry]], led by [[John Colborne]], which wheeled in line onto the chasseurs' flank and poured a devastating fire into them.

But whatever the part played by Prussian troops in the actual moment when the Imperial Guard was repulsed, it is difficult to see how Wellington could have staved off defeat, when his centre had been almost shattered, his reserves were almost all committed, the French right remained unmolested and the Imperial Guard intact. …. Blücher may not have been totally responsible for victory over Napoleon, but he deserved full credit for preventing a British defeat\".{{sfn|Parkinson|2000|pp=240–241}} Steele (2014) writes: \"Blücher's arrival not only diverted vital reinforcements, but also forced Napoleon to accelerate his effort against Wellington. The tide of battle had been turned by the hard-driving Blücher. As his Prussians pushed in Napoleon's flank. Wellington was able to shift to the offensive\".{{sfn|Steele|2014|p=178}}\n\n==Battlefield today==\n{{further information|List of Waterloo Battlefield locations}}\n[[File:Waterloo Lion.jpg|thumb|The [[Lion's Mound]] at Waterloo]]\n\nSome portions of the terrain on the battlefield have been altered from their 1815 appearance. Tourism began the day after the battle, with Captain Mercer noting that on 19 June \"a carriage drove on the ground from Brussels, the inmates of which, alighting, proceeded to examine the field\".{{sfn|Mercer|1870a|p=345}} In 1820, the Netherlands' King [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]] ordered the construction of a monument. The [[Lion's Hillock]], a giant mound, was constructed here using {{convert|300000|m3|cuyd}} of earth taken from the ridge at the centre of the British line, effectively removing the southern bank of Wellington's sunken road.\n\n{{quote|Every one is aware that the variously inclined undulations of the plains, where the engagement between Napoleon and Wellington took place, are no longer what they were on 18&nbsp;June 1815. By taking from this mournful field the wherewithal to make a monument to it, its real relief has been taken away, and history, disconcerted, no longer finds her bearings there. It has been disfigured for the sake of glorifying it. Wellington, when he beheld Waterloo once more, two years later, exclaimed, \"They have altered my field of battle!\" Where the great pyramid of earth, surmounted by the lion, rises to-day, there was a hillock which descended in an easy slope towards the Nivelles road, but which was almost an escarpment on the side of the highway to Genappe. The elevation of this escarpment can still be measured by the height of the two knolls of the two great sepulchres which enclose the road from Genappe to Brussels: one, the English tomb, is on the left; the other, the German tomb, is on the right. There is no French tomb. The whole of that plain is a sepulchre for France.|[[Victor Hugo]], ''[[Les Misérables]]''.{{sfn|Hugo|1862|loc=Chapter VII: Napoleon in a Good Humor}} }}\n\nThe alleged remark by Wellington about the alteration of the battlefield as described by Hugo was never documented, however.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nOther terrain features and notable landmarks on the field have remained virtually unchanged since the battle. These include the rolling farmland to the east of the Brussels–Charleroi Road as well as the buildings at Hougoumont, La Haye Sainte, and La Belle Alliance.\n\nApart from the Lion Mound, there are several more conventional but noteworthy monuments throughout the battlefield. A cluster of monuments at the Brussels–Charleroi and Braine L'Alleud–Ohain crossroads marks the mass graves of British, Dutch, Hanoverian and [[King's German Legion]] troops. A monument to the French dead, entitled ''L'Aigle blessé'' (\"The Wounded Eagle\"), marks the location where it is believed one of the Imperial Guard units formed a square during the closing moments of the battle.{{sfn|Hoorebeeke|2007|pp=6–21}}\n\nA monument to the Prussian dead is located in the village of [[Plancenoit]] on the site where one of their artillery batteries took position. The [[Guillaume Philibert Duhesme|Duhesme]] mausoleum is one among the few graves of the fallen. It is located at the side of Saint Martin's Church in Ways, a hamlet in the municipality of [[Genappe]]. Seventeen fallen officers are buried in the crypt of the [[Brussels Cemetery#The British Waterloo Campaign Monument|British Monument]] in the [[Brussels Cemetery]] in [[Evere]].{{sfn|Hoorebeeke|2007|pp=6–21}} The remains of a 23-year-old soldier named Friederich Brandt were discovered in 2012.{{sfn|Paton|2015}} He was a slightly hunchbacked infantryman, {{convert|1.60|m|ft}} tall, and was hit in the chest by a French bullet. His rifle, coins, and position on the battlefield identified him as an Hanoverian fighting in the [[King's German Legion]].{{sfn|Peel|2012}}\n\n==Coin controversy==\nAs part of the bicentennial celebration of the battle, in 2015 [[Belgium]] minted a 2 [[Euro]] coin depicting the Lion monument over a map of the field of battle. France officially protested this issue, while the Belgian government noted that the French mint sells souvenir medals at Waterloo.{{sfn|Torfs|2015}} After 180,000 coins were minted but not released, the issue was melted. Instead, Belgium issued an identical commemorative coin in the non-standard value of 2½ Euros. Legally only valid within the issuing country (but unlikely to circulate) it was minted in brass, packaged, and sold by the Belgian mint for 6 Euros. A 10 Euro coin, showing Wellington, Blücher, their troops and the silhouette of Napoleon, was also available in silver for 42 Euros.{{sfn|Kottasova|2015}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Napoleonic Wars}}\n* [[Lord Uxbridge's leg]] was shattered by a [[grape-shot]] at the Battle of Waterloo and removed by a surgeon.

Fought ten years after the [[Battle of Crécy]], it was the second of three major English victories during the war. The third, [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]], was fought in 1415.\n\nThe battle was fought on 19 September 1356 near the village of [[Poitiers]] in [[Aquitaine]], southern France. An army of English, Welsh, [[Duchy of Brittany|Breton]] and [[Duchy of Gascony|Gascon]] troops, many of them veterans of [[Battle of Crécy|Crécy]], led by [[Edward, the Black Prince]], defeated a larger French and allied army led by King [[John II of France]], leading to the capture of the king, [[Philip the Bold|his son]], and much of the French nobility.<ref name=bbook237>{{cite book | first=Bryan | last=Perrett | title=The Battle Book | publisher=Arms and Armour Press | location=London, England | year=1992 | isbn=1-85409-328-2 |page= 237}}</ref>\n\nThe effect of the defeat on France was catastrophic, leaving the country in the hands of the [[Charles V of France|Dauphin Charles]]. Charles faced [[Jacquerie|populist revolts across the kingdom]] in the wake of the battle, which had destroyed the prestige of the French upper-class. The Edwardian phase of the war would end four years later in 1360, [[Treaty of Brétigny|on favourable terms for England]].\n\nThe town and battle were often referred to as ''Poictiers'' in contemporaneous recordings, a name commemorated in [[HMS Poictiers|several warships of the Royal Navy]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Kendall B.

Edward had been reluctant to pay homage to [[Philip VI of France|Philip]] in his role as [[Duke of Aquitaine]], resulting in Philip confiscating these lands in 1337, precipitating war between the two nations. Three years later, Edward declared himself [[King of France]]. The war had begun well for the English. They had achieved naval domination early in the war at the [[Battle of Sluys]] in 1340,<ref>Henri de Wailly. Introduction by Emmanuel Bourassin, Crecy 1346: Anatomy of a Battle (Blandford Press, Poole, Dorset 1987) p. 10</ref> inflicted a severe defeat on the French army at [[Battle of Crecy|Crécy]] in 1346, and [[Siege of Calais (1346–47)|captured Calais in 1347]].\n\nIn the late 1340s and early 1350s, the [[Black Death]] decimated the population of Western Europe, bringing all significant efforts in campaigning to a halt, one such victim being [[Philip VI of France]] himself. In 1355, Edward III laid out plans for a second major campaign. His eldest son, [[Edward, the Black Prince]], now an experienced soldier following the Crécy campaign, landed at [[Bordeaux]] in Aquitaine, leading his army on a march through southern France to [[Carcassonne]]. Unable to take the heavily fortified settlement, Edward withdrew to Bordeaux. In early 1356, the [[Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster|Duke of Lancaster]] led an army through [[Normandy]], while Edward led his army on a great [[chevauchée]] from Bordeaux on 8 August 1356.<ref>William W. Lace, ''The Hundred Years' War'' {{ISBN|978-1-56006-233-2}}, 1/1994</ref>\n\nEdward's forces met little resistance, sacking numerous settlements, until they reached the [[Loire River]] at [[Tours]]. They were unable to take the castle or burn the town due to a heavy rainstorm. This delay allowed [[John II of France|King John II]] to attempt to pin down and destroy Edward's army. John, who had been besieging [[Breteuil, Eure|Breteuil]] in [[Normandy]], organised the bulk of his army at [[Chartres]] to the north of Tours. In order to increase the speed of his army's march, he dismissed between 15,000 and 20,000 of his lower quality infantry, just as Edward turned back to Bordeaux.<ref>Jonathan Sumption, ''The Hundred Years' War: Vol. 2: Trial by Fire'' (London: Faber, 2001), pp. 223, 227–228</ref> The French rode hard and cut in front of the English army, crossing the bridge over the Vienne at Chauvigny.  Learning of this, the Black Prince quickly moved his army south.  Historians disagree over whether the outnumbered English commander was seeking battle or trying to avoid it.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rogers|first1=Clifford J.|title=War Cruel and Sharp: English Strategy under Edward III|date=2000|publisher=Boydell and Brewwer|location=Woodbridge|pages=348-373}}</ref>  In any case, after preliminary maneuvers and failed negotiations for a truce, the two armies faced off, both ready for battle, near [[Poitiers]] on Monday, 19 September 1356.\n\n== Battle ==\n[[File:Battle-poitiers(1356).jpg|300px|thumb|Battle of Poitiers (miniature of Froissart)]]\n\n=== Preparations ===\nEdward arrayed his army in a defensive posture among the hedges and orchards of the area, in front of the forest of Nouallie. He deployed his front line of longbowmen behind a particularly prominent thick hedge, through which the road ran at right angles. The Earl of Douglas, commanding the Scottish division in the French army, advised King John that the attack should be delivered on foot, with horses being particularly vulnerable to English arrows. John heeded this advice, leaving its baggage behind and forming up on foot in front of the English.\n\n==== English army ====\nThe English army was led by [[Edward, the Black Prince]], primarily composed of English and Welsh troops, though there was a large contingent of [[Duchy of Gascony|Gascon]] and [[Duchy of Brittany|Breton]] soldiers with the army. Edward's army consisted of approximately 2,000 [[longbow]]men, 3,000 [[men-at-arms]] and a force of 1,000 Gascon infantry.\n\nLike the earlier engagement at [[Battle of Crécy|Crécy]], the power of the English army lay in the [[longbow]]; a tall, thick self-bow made of yew. Longbows had demonstrated their effectiveness against massed infantry and cavalry in several battles, such as; [[Battle of Falkirk|Falkirk]] in 1298, [[Battle of Halidon Hill|Halidon Hill]] in 1333 and [[Battle of Crécy|Crécy]] ten years prior, in 1346. Poitiers was the second of three major English victories of the [[Hundred Years' War]] attributed to the longbow, though its effectiveness against armoured French knights and men-at-arms has been disputed.<ref>Strickland & Hardy 2005, pp. 272–278</ref><ref>Kaiser 2003</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rogers|first1=Clifford J.|title=The Efficacy of the Medieval Longbow: A Reply to Kelly DeVries|journal=War in History|date=1998|volume=5|issue=2|pages=233-42|url=https://www.academia.edu/13146838/_The_Efficacy_of_the_Medieval_Longbow_A_Reply_to_Kelly_DeVries_War_in_History_5_no._2_1998_233-42}}</ref>\n\n[[Geoffrey the Baker]] wrote that the English archers under the earl of Salisbury \"made their arrows prevail over the [French] knights' armor,\"<ref>Edward Maunde Thompson, ''Chronicle of Geoffrey le Baker'', (Oxford at the Clarendon Press 1889) p. 147 (\"coegerunt sagittas armis militaribus prevalere\") (</ref> but the bowmen on the other flank, under Warwick, were initially ineffective against the mounted French men-at-arms who enjoyed the double protection of steel plate armor and large leather shields.<ref>{{cite book|last=Barber|first=Richard|title=The Life and Campaigns of the Black Prince|year=1986|publisher=Boydell Press|location=Woodbridge|isbn=0-85115-435-2|page=76}}</ref> Once Warwick's archers redeployed to a position where they could hit the unarmored sides and backs of the horses, however, they quickly routed the cavalry force opposing them.

Green, ''The Battle of Poitiers 1356'', (Tempus Publishing, Charleston, S.C., 2002)</ref><ref>Edward Maunde Thompson, ''Chronicle of Geoffrey le Baker'', (Oxford at the Clarendon Press 1889) p. 304</ref>\n\nThe English army was an experienced force; many archers were veterans of the earlier [[Battle of Crécy]], and two of the key commanders, [[John Chandos|Sir John Chandos]], and [[Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch|Captal de Buch]] were both experienced soldiers. The English army's divisions were led by [[Edward, the Black Prince]], the [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]], the [[William de Montagu, 2nd Earl of Salisbury|Earl of Salisbury]], [[John Chandos|Sir John Chandos]] and [[Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch|Captal de Buch]].\n\n==== French army ====\nThe French army was led by [[John II of France]], and was largely composed of native French soldiers, though there was a contingent of [[Holy Roman Empire|German knights]], and a large force of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] soldiers.  The latter force was led by the [[William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas|Earl of Douglas]] and fought in the King's own division.<ref>William F. Skene, ''John of Fordun’s Chronicle of the Scottish Nation'', (Edinburgh Edmonston and Douglas 1872), p. 365</ref> The French army at the battle comprised approximately 8,000 men-at-arms and 3,000 common infantry, though John had made the decision to leave behind the vast majority of his infantry, numbering up to 20,000, in order to overtake and force the English to battle.\n\nThe French army was arrayed in three \"battles\" or divisions; the vanguard was led by the [[Charles V of France|Dauphin Charles]], the second by the [[Philip, Duke of Orléans|Duke of Orléans]], while the third, the largest, was led by the King himself.\n\n=== Negotiations ===\nPrior to the battle, the local prelate, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Hélie de Talleyrand-Périgord (cardinal)|Hélie de Talleyrand-Périgord]] attempted to broker a truce between the two sides, as recorded in the writings of the English commander, [[John Chandos|Sir John Chandos]].<ref>Mildred K. Pope; Eleanor C. Lodge, ''Life of the Black Prince by the Herald of Sir John Chandos'' (Oxford, UK Clarendon Press 1910), p. 857</ref> Attending the conference on the French side was [[John II of France]], the [[Earl of Tankerville|Count of Tankerville]], the Archbishop of Sens and [[Jean II de Talaru|Jean de Talaru]]. Representing the English was the [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]], the [[Robert d'Ufford, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Earl of Suffolk]], [[Bartholomew de Burghersh, 2nd Baron Burghersh|Bartholomew de Burghersh]], [[James Audley]] and [[John Chandos|Sir John Chandos]]. The English offered to hand over all of the war booty they had taken on their raids throughout France, as well as a seven-year truce. John, who believed his force could easily overwhelm the English, declined their proposal. John's counter suggestion that the Black Prince and his army should surrender was flatly rejected.\n\n=== Fighting begins<ref> This section reflects the traditional narrative of the battle, which relies to a substantial extent on the chronicle of Jean Froissart.  For an alternative narrative based on the assumption that Froissart's narrative is not reliable, see Clifford J. Rogers, [https://www.academia.edu/34425406/The_Battle_of_Poitiers_1356_English_Version_ \"The Battle of Poitiers, 1356\"] (English-language version of  “La batalla de Poitiers (1356),” ''Desperta  Ferro.

Antigua y medieval'' 38 (2016), 28-38)</ref> ===\n[[File:Battle of Poitiers 1356 map-en.svg|300px|thumb|Map of the Battle]]\n\nAt the start of the battle, the English removed their [[Wagon train|baggage train]] from the field, prompting a hasty French assault, believing that what they saw was the English retreating.<ref name=\"MM99\">{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Urban |first=William L. |year=2006|title=Medieval Mercenaries: The Business of War|publisher=Greenhill Books |location=London|page=99}}</ref> The fighting began with a charge by a [[forlorn hope]] of 300 [[Holy Roman Empire|German]] knights, led by [[Jean de Clermont]]. The attack was a disaster, with many of the knights shot down or killed by English soldiery. According to [[Froissart's Chronicles|Froissart]], the English archers then shot their bows at the massed French infantry. The Dauphin's division reached the English line. Exhausted by a long march in heavy equipment and harassed by the hail of arrows, the division was repulsed after approximately two hours of combat.<ref>''[http://home.eckerd.edu/~oberhot/poitiers.htm Battle of Poitiers]''</ref>\n\nThe retreating vanguard collided with the advancing division of the [[Philip, Duke of Orléans|Duke of Orléans]], throwing the French army into chaos. Seeing the Dauphin's troops falling back, Orléans' division fell back in confusion. The third, and strongest, division led by the King advanced forth, and the two withdrawing divisions coalesced and resumed their advance against the English. Believing that the retreat of the first two French divisions marked the withdrawal of the French, Edward had ordered a force under [[Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch|Captal de Buch]] to pursue. [[John Chandos|Sir John Chandos]] urged the Prince to launch this force upon the main body of the French army under the King. Seizing upon this idea, Edward ordered all his men-at-arms and knights to mount for the charge, while de Buch's men, already mounted, were instructed to advance around the French left flank and rear.\n\n==== Capture of King John II ====\n[[Image:Capture de Jean le Bon.jpg|thumb|300px|Jean II, the Good, being captured.]]\n\nAs the French advanced, the English launched their charge. Stunned by the attack, the impetus carried the English and Gascon forces right into the French line. Simultaneously, de Buch's mobile reserve of mounted troops fell upon the French left flank and rear. Fearful of encirclement, the cohesion of the French army disintegrated as many soldiers attempted to flee the field. Low on arrows, the English and Welsh archers abandoned their bows and ran forward to join the melée. Around this time, King John and his son, [[Philip the Bold]], found themselves surrounded. As written by [[Froissart]], an exiled French knight fighting with the English, Sir Denis Morbeke of Artois approached the king, requesting the King's surrender. The King is said to have replied, \"To whom shall I yield me? Where is my cousin the Prince of Wales? If I might see him, I would speak with him\". Denis replied; \"Sir, he is not here; but yield you to me and I shall bring you to him\". The king handed him his right gauntlet, saying; \"I yield me to you\".<ref>''Chronicle and romance : Froissart, Malory, Holinshed''.

Collier & Son 1910) out of copyright p. 53</ref>\n\nFollowing the surrender of the King and his son Philip, the French army had broken up and left the field, ending the battle.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nFollowing the battle, Edward resumed his march back to the English stronghold at Bordeaux. [[Jean de Venette]], a Carmelite friar, vividly describes the chaos that ensued following the battle. The demise of the French nobility at the battle, only ten years from the catastrophe at [[Battle of Crécy|Crécy]], threw the kingdom into chaos. The realm was left in the hands of the [[Charles V of France|Dauphin Charles]], who faced [[Jacquerie|popular rebellion across the kingdom]] in the wake of the defeat. Jean writes that the French nobles brutally repressed the rebellions, robbing, despoiling and pillaging the peasants' goods. [[Free company|Mercenary companies]] hired by both sides added to the destruction, who plundered the peasants and churches.<ref>Jean Birdsall, Richard A. Newhall, ''The Chronicles of Jean de Venette '' (Columbia University Press 1953) p. 6</ref>\n\nCharles, to the misery of the French peasantry, began to raise additional funds to pay for the [[ransom]] of his father, and to continue the war effort. Capitalising on the discontent in France, [[Edward III of England|King Edward]] assembled his army at [[Calais]] in 1359 and led his army on a campaign against [[Rheims]]. Unable to take Rheims or the French capital, [[Paris]], Edward moved his army to [[Chartres]]. Later, the Dauphin Charles offered to open negotiations, and Edward agreed.\n\nThe [[Treaty of Brétigny]] was ratified on 24 October 1360, ending the Edwardian phase of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. In it, Edward agreed to renounce his claims to the French throne, in exchange for full sovereign rights over an expanded Aquitaine and Calais, essentially restoring the former [[Angevin Empire]].\n\n== Nobles and men-at-arms present ==\n=== English ===\n\n[[Jean Froissart|Froissart]] states these men fought with the Black Prince:<br>\n[[Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick]]<br>\n[[William de Ufford, 2nd Earl of Suffolk]]<br>\n[[William de Montacute, 2nd Earl of Salisbury]]<br>\n[[John de Vere, 7th Earl of Oxford]]<br>\n[[Reginald de Cobham, 1st Baron Cobham]]<br>\n[[Edward le Despencer, 1st Baron le Despencer]]<br>\n[[James Audley|Lord James Audley]]<br>\nLord Peter Audley<br>\nLord Berkeley<br>\nLord Basset<br>\nLord Warin<br>\nLord Delaware<br>\nLord Manne<br>\nLord Willoughby<br>\nLord Bartholomew de Burghersh<br>\nLord of Felton<br>\nLord Richard of Pembroke<br>\nLord Stephen of Cosington<br>\nLord Bradetane<br>\nLord of Pommiers<br>\nLord of [[Langoiran|Languiran]]<br>\n[[Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch|Captal of Buch]]<br>\nLord John the 69th of Caumont<br>\nLord de [[Lesparre-Médoc|Lesparre]]<br>\nLord of [[Rauzan]]<br>\nLord of Condon<br>\nLord of [[Montferrand (district of Clermont-Ferrand)|Montferrand]]<br>\nLord of [[Landiras]]<br>\nLord Soudic of Latrau<br>\nLord Eustace d'Aubrecicourt<br>\nLord John of Ghistelles<br>\nLord Daniel Pasele<br>\nLord Denis of Amposta<ref>John Bourchier; G.

This formed part of a larger strategy to break the British [[blockade of Germany]] and to allow German naval vessels access to the Atlantic. Meanwhile, Great Britain's Royal Navy pursued a strategy of engaging and destroying the High Seas Fleet, thereby keeping German naval forces contained and away from Britain and her [[Sea lines of communication|shipping lanes]].<ref>{{cite news|title= ''Distant Victory: The Battle of Jutland and the Allied Triumph in the First World War'', page XCIV |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VlTmHeEYgxsC&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=battle+of+jutland+germany+wanted+access+to+the+atlantic&source=bl&ots=6Z2ftnrc0N&sig=2oRrq40o4U9c8slBn4KgzFwBftU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-7JWuz4LNAhUmCcAKHYDqAasQ6AEISjAI#v=onepage&q=battle%20of%20jutland%20germany%20wanted%20access%20to%20the%20atlantic&f=false|date= July 2006|publisher= Praeger Security International|accessdate= 30 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Germans planned to use Vice-Admiral [[Franz von Hipper|Franz Hipper]]'s fast scouting group of five modern [[battlecruiser]]s to lure Vice-Admiral [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Sir David Beatty's]] battlecruiser squadrons into the path of the main German fleet. They stationed submarines in advance across the likely routes of the British ships. However, the British learned from signal intercepts that a major fleet operation was likely, so on 30 May Jellicoe sailed with the Grand Fleet to rendezvous with Beatty, passing over the locations of the German submarine [[Picket (military)|picket lines]] while they were unprepared. The German plan had been delayed, causing further problems for their submarines, which had reached the limit of their endurance at sea.\n\nOn the afternoon of 31 May, Beatty encountered Hipper's battlecruiser force long before the Germans had expected. In a running battle, Hipper successfully drew the British [[vanguard]] into the path of the High Seas Fleet. By the time Beatty sighted the larger force and turned back towards the British main fleet, he had lost two battlecruisers from a force of six battlecruisers and four powerful battleships &ndash; though he had sped ahead of his battleships of [[5th Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)#Battle of Jutland|5th Battle Squadron]] earlier in the day, effectively losing them as an integral component for much of this opening action against the five ships commanded by Hipper. Beatty's withdrawal at the sight of the High Seas Fleet, which the British had not known were in the open sea, would reverse the course of the battle by drawing the German fleet in pursuit towards the British Grand Fleet. Between 18:30, when the sun was lowering on the western horizon, back-lighting the German forces, and nightfall at about 20:30, the two fleets – totalling 250 ships between them – directly engaged twice.\n\nFourteen British and eleven German ships sank, with great loss of life. After sunset, and throughout the night, Jellicoe manoeuvred to cut the Germans off from their base, hoping to continue the battle the next morning, but under the cover of darkness Scheer broke through the British light forces forming the rearguard of the Grand Fleet and returned to port.<ref>Campbell, ''Analysis'' pp. 274</ref>\n\nBoth sides claimed victory. The British lost more ships and twice as many sailors but succeeded in containing the German fleet. However, the British press criticised the Grand Fleet's failure to force a decisive outcome, while Scheer's plan of destroying a substantial portion of the British fleet also failed. Finally, the British strategy of denying Germany access to both the United Kingdom and the Atlantic did succeed, which was the British long-term goal.<ref>{{cite news|title= ''Distant Victory: The Battle of Jutland and the Allied Triumph in the First World War'', page XCV |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VlTmHeEYgxsC&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=battle+of+jutland+germany+wanted+access+to+the+atlantic&source=bl&ots=6Z2ftnrc0N&sig=2oRrq40o4U9c8slBn4KgzFwBftU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-7JWuz4LNAhUmCcAKHYDqAasQ6AEISjAI#v=onepage&q=battle%20of%20jutland%20germany%20wanted%20access%20to%20the%20atlantic&f=false|date= July 2006|publisher= Praeger Security International|accessdate= 30 May 2016}}</ref> The Germans' \"[[fleet in being]]\" continued to pose a threat, requiring the British to keep their battleships concentrated in the North Sea, but the battle reinforced the German policy of avoiding all fleet-to-fleet contact. At the end of 1916, after further unsuccessful attempts to reduce the Royal Navy's numerical advantage, the German Navy accepted that its surface ships had been successfully contained, subsequently turning its efforts and resources to [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] and the destruction of Allied and neutral shipping, which - along with the [[Zimmermann Telegram]] - by April 1917 triggered the [[United States|United States of America]]'s declaration of war on Germany.<ref>Protasio, John. (2011). ''The Day the World was Shocked: The Lusitania Disaster and Its Influence on the Course of World War I'' pp.200–201, Casemate Publications (US) {{ISBN|978-1-935149-45-3}}</ref>\n\nSubsequent reviews commissioned by the Royal Navy generated strong disagreement between supporters of Jellicoe and Beatty concerning the two admirals' performance in the battle. Debate over their performance and the significance of the battle continues to this day.\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Background and planning==\n\n===German planning===\nWith 16 [[dreadnought]]-type battleships, compared with the Royal Navy's 28, the German [[High Seas Fleet]] stood little chance of winning a head-to-head clash. The Germans therefore adopted a [[Defeat in detail|divide-and-conquer strategy]]. They would stage raids into the North Sea and bombard the English coast, with the aim of luring out small British squadrons and pickets, which could then be destroyed by superior forces or submarines.\n\nIn January 1916, Admiral [[Hugo von Pohl|von Pohl]], commander of the German fleet, fell ill. He was replaced by Scheer, who believed that the fleet had been used too defensively, had better ships and men than the British, and ought to take the war to them.<ref>Tarrant p.49</ref> According to Scheer, the German [[naval strategy]] should be:\n\n{{quote |to damage the English fleet by offensive raids against the naval forces engaged in watching and blockading the [[Heligoland Bight|German Bight]], as well as by [[naval mine|mine]]-laying on the British coast and [[submarine]] attack, whenever possible. After an equality of strength had been realised as a result of these operations, and all our forces had been made ready and concentrated, an attempt was to be made with our fleet to seek battle under circumstances unfavourable to the enemy.}}\n\n[[File:Almirante Reinhard Scheer.jpg|thumb|[[Reinhard Scheer]], German fleet commander]]\n\nOn 25 April 1916, a decision was made by the German admiralty to halt indiscriminate attacks by submarine on merchant shipping. This followed protests from neutral countries, notably the United States, that their nationals had been the victims of attacks. Germany agreed that future attacks would only take place in accord with internationally agreed prize rules, which required an attacker to give a warning and allow the crews of vessels time to escape, and not to attack neutral vessels at all. Scheer believed that it would not be possible to continue attacks on these terms, which took away the advantage of secret approach by submarines and left them vulnerable to even relatively small guns on the target ships. Instead, he set about deploying the submarine fleet against military vessels.<ref>Tarrant p. 55</ref>\n\nIt was hoped that, following a successful German submarine attack, fast British escorts, such as [[destroyer]]s, would be tied down by anti-submarine operations. If the Germans could catch the British in the expected locations, good prospects were thought to exist of at least partially redressing the balance of forces between the fleets. \"After the British sortied in response to the raiding attack force\", the Royal Navy's centuries-old instincts for aggressive action could be exploited to draw its weakened units towards the main German fleet under Scheer. The hope was that Scheer would thus be able to ambush a section of the British fleet and destroy it.<ref>Campbell, p. 2</ref>\n\n====Submarine deployments====\nA plan was devised to station submarines offshore from British naval bases, and then stage some action that would draw out the British ships to the waiting submarines. The battlecruiser {{SMS|Seydlitz}} had been damaged in a previous engagement, but was due to be repaired by mid May, so an operation was scheduled for 17 May 1916. At the start of May, difficulties with condensers were discovered on ships of the third battleship squadron, so the operation was put back to 23 May. Ten submarines—{{SMU|U-24||2}}, {{SMU|U-32|Germany|2}}, {{SMU|U-43|Germany|2}}, {{SMU|U-44||2}}, {{SMU|UC-47||2}}, {{SMU|U-51||2}}, {{SMU|U-52||2}}, {{SMU|U-63|Germany|2}}, {{SMU|U-66||2}}, and {{SMU|U-70||2}}—were given orders first to patrol in the central North Sea between 17 and 22 May, and then to take up waiting positions. ''U-43'' and ''U-44'' were stationed in the [[Pentland Firth]], which the Grand Fleet was likely to cross leaving [[Scapa Flow]], while the remainder proceeded to the [[Firth of Forth]], awaiting battlecruisers departing [[Rosyth Dockyard|Rosyth]]. Each boat had an allocated area, within which it could move around as necessary to avoid detection, but was instructed to keep within it. During the initial North Sea patrol the boats were instructed to sail only north–south so that any enemy who chanced to encounter one would believe it was departing or returning from operations on the west coast (which required them to pass around the north of Britain). Once at their final positions, the boats were under strict orders to avoid premature detection that might give away the operation. It was arranged that a coded signal would be transmitted to alert the submarines exactly when the operation commenced: \"Take into account the enemy's forces may be putting to sea\".<ref>Tarrant p. 56-57</ref>\n\nAdditionally, ''UB-27'' was sent out on 20 May with instructions to work its way into the Firth of Forth past [[Isle of May|May Island]]. ''U-46'' was ordered to patrol the coast of [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], which had been chosen for the diversionary attack, but because of engine problems it was unable to leave port and ''U-47'' was diverted to this task. On 13 May, ''U-72'' was sent to lay mines in the Firth of Forth; on the 23rd, ''U-74'' departed to lay mines in the Moray Firth; and on the 24th, ''U-75'' was dispatched similarly west of the Orkney Islands. ''UB-21'' and ''UB-22'' were sent to patrol the Humber, where (incorrect) reports had suggested the presence of British warships. ''U-22'', ''U-46'' and ''U-67'' were positioned north of Terschelling to protect against intervention by British light forces stationed at Harwich.<ref>Tarrant pp. 57–58</ref>\n\nOn 22 May 1916, it was discovered that ''Seydlitz'' was still not watertight after repairs and would not now be ready until the 29th. The ambush submarines were now on station and experiencing difficulties of their own: visibility near the coast was frequently poor due to fog, and sea conditions were either so calm the slightest ripple, as from the periscope, could give away their position, or so rough as to make it very hard to keep the vessel at a steady depth. The British had become aware of unusual submarine activity, and had begun counter patrols that forced the submarines out of position. ''UB-27'' passed Bell Rock on the night of 23 May on its way into the Firth of Forth as planned, but was halted by engine trouble. After repairs it continued to approach, following behind merchant vessels, and reached Largo Bay on 25 May. There the boat became entangled in nets that fouled one of the propellers, forcing it to abandon the operation and return home. ''U-74'' was detected by four armed trawlers on 27 May and sunk {{convert|25|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} south-east of Peterhead. ''U-75'' laid its mines off the Orkney Islands, which, although they played no part in the battle, were responsible later for sinking the cruiser {{HMS|Hampshire|1903|2}} carrying [[Herbert Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] (head of the army) on a mission to Russia on 5 June. ''U-72'' was forced to abandon its mission without laying any mines when an oil leak meant it was leaving a visible surface trail astern.<ref>Tarrant pp. 58–60</ref>\n\n====Zeppelins====\n{{refimprove section|date=May 2017}}\n[[File:Carte Skagerrak-Kattegat2.png|thumb|The throat of the [[Skagerrak]], the strategic gateway to the Baltic and North Atlantic, waters off Jutland, Norway and Sweden]]\nThe Germans maintained a fleet of [[Zeppelin]]s that they used for aerial reconnaissance and occasional bombing raids. The planned raid on Sunderland intended to use Zeppelins to watch out for the British fleet approaching from the north, which might otherwise surprise the raiders.\n\nBy 28 May, strong north-easterly winds meant that it would not be possible to send out the Zeppelins, so the raid again had to be postponed. The submarines could only stay on station until 1 June before their supplies would be exhausted and they had to return, so a decision had to be made quickly about the raid.\n\nIt was decided to use an alternative plan, abandoning the attack on Sunderland but instead sending a patrol of battlecruisers to the [[Skagerrak]], where it was likely they would encounter merchant ships carrying British cargo and British cruiser patrols. It was felt this could be done without air support, because the action would now be much closer to Germany, relying instead on cruiser and torpedo boat patrols for reconnaissance.\n\nOrders for the alternative plan were issued on 28 May, although it was still hoped that last-minute improvements in the weather would allow the original plan to go ahead. The German fleet assembled in the [[Jade (river)|Jade River]] and at [[Wilhelmshaven]] and was instructed to raise steam and be ready for action from midnight on 28 May.<ref>Tarrant p. 61</ref>\n\n[[File:Vizeadmiral Hipper, der Befehlshaber der deutschen Aufklärungsschiffe in der Seeschlacht.png|thumb|left|[[Franz von Hipper|Franz Hipper]], commander of the German battlecruiser squadron]]\n\nBy 14:00 on 30 May, the wind was still too strong and the final decision was made to use the alternative plan. The coded signal \"31 May G.G.2490\" was transmitted to the ships of the fleet to inform them the Skagerrak attack would start on 31 May. The pre-arranged signal to the waiting submarines was transmitted throughout the day from the E-Dienst radio station at [[Brugge]], and the U-boat tender ''Arcona'' anchored at [[Emden]]. Only two of the waiting submarines, {{SMU|U-66||2}} and {{SMU|U-32|Germany|2}}, received the order.<ref>Tarrant pp. 62, 60, 65</ref>\n\n===British response===\nUnfortunately for the German plan, the British had obtained a copy of the main German codebook from the light cruiser {{SMS|Magdeburg||6}}, which had been boarded by the [[Imperial Russian Navy|Russian Navy]] after the ship ran aground in Russian [[territorial waters]] in 1914. German naval radio communications could therefore often be quickly deciphered, and the British [[Admiralty]] usually knew about German activities.\n\nThe British Admiralty's [[Room 40]] maintained [[direction finding]] and interception of German naval signals. It had intercepted and decrypted a German signal on 28 May that provided \"ample evidence that the German fleet was stirring in the North Sea.\"<ref>Stille, Mark. British Dreadnought vs. German Dreadnought: Jutland 1916. 2010. Osprey Publishing.[Page 56]</ref> Further signals were intercepted, and although they were not decrypted it was clear that a major operation was likely. At 11:00 on 30 May, Jellicoe was warned that the German fleet seemed prepared to sail the following morning. By 17:00, the Admiralty had intercepted the signal from Scheer, \"31 May G.G.2490\", making it clear something significant was imminent.<ref>Tarrant pp. 63–64</ref>\n\nNot knowing the Germans' objective, Jellicoe and his staff decided to position the fleet to head off any attempt by the Germans to enter the North Atlantic, or the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] through the Skagerrak, by taking up a position off Norway where they could possibly cut off any German raid into the shipping lanes of the Atlantic, or prevent the Germans from heading into the Baltic. A position further west was unnecessary, as that area of the [[North Sea]] could be patrolled by air using blimps and scouting aircraft.{{citation needed|date = May 2012}}\n\n[[File:John Jellicoe, Admiral of the Fleet.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|John Jellicoe]], British fleet commander]]\nConsequently, Admiral Jellicoe led the sixteen dreadnought battleships of the 1st and 4th Battle Squadrons of the Grand Fleet and three battlecruisers of the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron eastwards out of [[Scapa Flow]] at 22:30 on 30 May. He was to meet the 2nd Battle Squadron of eight dreadnought battleships commanded by Vice-Admiral [[Martyn Jerram]] coming from [[Cromarty]]. Hipper's raiding force did not leave the [[Jade Estuary|Outer Jade Roads]] until 01:00 on 31 May, heading west of Heligoland Island following a cleared channel through the minefields, heading north at {{convert|16|kn|lk=in}}. The main German fleet of sixteen dreadnought battleships of 1st and 3rd Battle Squadrons left the Jade at 02:30, being joined off Heligoland at 04:00 by the six pre-dreadnoughts of the 2nd Battle Squadron coming from the Elbe River. Beatty's faster force of six ships of the 1st and 2nd Battlecruiser Squadrons plus the [[5th Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)#Battle of Jutland|5th Battle Squadron]] of four fast battleships left the Firth of Forth on the next day;{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Jellicoe intended to rendezvous with him {{convert|90|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} west of the mouth of the Skagerrak off the coast of Jutland and wait for the Germans to appear or for their intentions to become clear. The planned position would give him the widest range of responses to likely German moves.<ref>Tarrant p. 64</ref>\n\n==Naval tactics in 1916==\n\nThe principle of [[Force concentration|concentration of force]] was fundamental to the fleet tactics of this time (as in earlier periods). Tactical doctrine called for a fleet approaching battle to be in a compact formation of parallel columns, allowing relatively easy manoeuvring, and giving shortened sight lines within the formation, which simplified the passing of the signals necessary for command and control.<ref name=\"gwpda.org\">http://www.gwpda.org/naval/nr191401.htm</ref>\n\nA fleet formed in several short columns could change its heading faster than one formed in a single long column. Since most command signals were made with [[flag]]s or [[Aldis lamp|signal lamps]] between ships, the flagship was usually placed at the head of the centre column so that its signals might be more easily seen by the many ships of the formation. Wireless telegraphy was in use, though security (radio direction finding), encryption, and the limitation of the radio sets made their extensive use more problematic. Command and control of such huge fleets remained difficult.<ref name=\"gwpda.org\"/><ref>Sutherland, Cramwell, p. 13</ref>\n\nThus, it might take a very long time for a signal from the flagship to be relayed to the entire formation. It was usually necessary for a signal to be confirmed by each ship before it could be relayed to other ships, and an order for a fleet movement would have to be received and acknowledged by every ship before it could be executed. In a large single-column formation, a signal could take 10 minutes or more to be passed from one end of the line to the other, whereas in a formation of parallel columns, visibility across the diagonals was often better (and always shorter) than in a single long column, and the diagonals gave signal \"redundancy\", increasing the probability that a message would be quickly seen and correctly interpreted.<ref name=\"gwpda.org\"/>\n\nHowever, before battle was joined the heavy units of the fleet would, if possible, deploy into a single column. To form the battle line in the correct orientation relative to the enemy, the commanding admiral had to know the enemy fleet's distance, bearing, heading, and speed. It was the task of the scouting forces, consisting primarily of [[battlecruiser]]s and [[cruiser]]s, to find the enemy and report this information in sufficient time, and, if possible, to deny the enemy's scouting forces the opportunity of obtaining the equivalent information.<ref name=\"gwpda.org\"/>\n\nIdeally, the battle line would cross the intended path of the enemy column so that the maximum number of guns could be brought to bear, while the enemy could fire only with the forward guns of the leading ships, a manoeuvre known as \"[[crossing the T]]\". Admiral [[Tōgō Heihachirō|Tōgō]], commander of the Japanese battleship fleet, had achieved this against Admiral [[Zinovy Rozhestvensky]]'s Russian battleships in 1905 at the [[Battle of Tsushima]], with devastating results.<ref>Forczyk pp. 58–62</ref> Jellicoe achieved this twice in one hour against the High Seas Fleet at Jutland, but on both occasions, Scheer managed to turn away and disengage, thereby avoiding a decisive action. {{clear left}}\n\n===Ship design===\nWithin the existing technological limits, a trade-off had to be made between the weight and size of guns, the weight of armour protecting the ship, and the maximum speed. Battleships sacrificed speed for armour and heavy naval guns ({{convert|11|in|mm|abbr=on}} or larger). British battlecruisers sacrificed weight of armour for greater speed, while their German counterparts were armed with lighter guns and heavier armour. These weight savings allowed them to escape danger or catch other ships. Generally, the larger guns mounted on British ships allowed an engagement at greater range. In theory, a lightly armoured ship could stay out of range of a slower opponent while still scoring hits. The fast pace of development in the pre-war years meant that every few years, a new generation of ships rendered its predecessors obsolete. Thus, fairly young ships could still be obsolete compared to the newest ships, and fare badly in an engagement against them.<ref name=\"Castles666\">'Castles of Steel' p. 666</ref>\n\n[[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Admiral John Fisher]], responsible for reconstruction of the British fleet in the pre-war period, favoured large guns, oil fuel, and speed. [[Alfred von Tirpitz|Admiral Tirpitz]], responsible for the German fleet, favoured ship survivability and chose to sacrifice some gun size for improved armour. The German battlecruiser {{SMS|Derfflinger}} had [[belt armour]] equivalent in thickness—though not as comprehensive—to the British battleship {{HMS|Iron Duke|1912|6}}, significantly better than on the British battlecruisers such as ''Tiger''. German ships had better internal subdivision and had fewer doors and other weak points in their [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]], but with the disadvantage that space for crew was greatly reduced.<ref name=\"Castles666\"/> As they were designed only for sorties in the North Sea they did not need to be as habitable as the British vessels and their crews could live in barracks ashore when in harbour.<ref>Marder III p. 168</ref>\n\n==Order of battle==\n{{Main article|Order of battle at Jutland}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"2\" style=\"float:right; margin:10px; border:solid 1px #bbb;\"\n|-\n!\n!British\n!German\n|-\n|Dreadnought<br/>battleships\n|28\n|16\n|-\n|Pre-dreadnoughts\n|0\n|6\n|-\n|Battlecruisers\n|9\n|5\n|-\n|Armoured cruisers\n|8\n|0\n|-\n|Light cruisers\n|26\n|11\n|-\n|Destroyers\n|79\n|61\n|-\n|Seaplane carrier\n|1\n|0\n|}\nWarships of the period were armed with guns firing projectiles of varying weights, bearing [[high explosive]] warheads. The sum total of weight of all the projectiles fired by all the ship's guns is referred to as \"weight of broadside\". At Jutland, the total of the British ships' weight of broadside was {{convert|332,360|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, while the German fleet's total was {{convert|134,216|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref>Tarrant p.65</ref> This does not take into consideration the ability of some ships and their crews to fire more or less rapidly than others, which would increase or decrease amount of fire that one combatant was able to bring to bear on their opponent for any length of time.\n\nJellicoe's Grand Fleet was split into two sections. The dreadnought Battle Fleet, with which he sailed, formed the main force and was composed of 24 battleships and three battlecruisers. The battleships were formed into three squadrons of eight ships, further subdivided into divisions of four, each led by a [[flag officer]]. Accompanying them were eight [[armoured cruiser]]s (classified by the Royal Navy since 1913 as \"cruisers\"), eight [[light cruiser]]s, four [[scout cruiser]]s, 51 [[destroyer]]s, and one [[HMS Abdiel (1915)|destroyer-minelayer]].<ref>Jellicoe, Joe, The Grand Fleet, 1914–1916, London, Cassell, 1919</ref>\n\n[[File:Nw beatty 01.png|thumb|left|175px|[[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|David Beatty]], commander of the British battlecruiser fleet]]\nThe Grand Fleet sailed without three of its battleships: {{HMS|Emperor of India||2}} in refit at Invergordon, {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|2}} dry-docked at [[Rosyth Dockyard|Rosyth]] and {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|2}} in refit at Devonport. The brand new {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|05|2}} was left behind; with only three weeks in service, her untrained crew was judged unready for battle.<ref>Massie, p. 576</ref>\n\nBritish [[reconnaissance]] was provided by the Battlecruiser Fleet under David Beatty: six battlecruisers, four fast {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|battleship}}s, 14 light cruisers and 27 destroyers. Air scouting was provided by the attachment of the [[seaplane tender]] {{HMS|Engadine|1911|6}}, one of the first [[aircraft carrier]]s in history to participate in a naval engagement.<ref name=Camp-26>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=26}}</ref>\n\nThe German High Seas Fleet under Scheer was also split into a main force and a separate reconnaissance force. Scheer's main battle fleet was composed of 16 battleships and six [[Pre-dreadnought battleship|pre-dreadnought]] battleships arranged in an identical manner to the British. With them were six light cruisers and 31 [[torpedo-boat]]s, (the latter being roughly equivalent to a British destroyer).{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nThe German scouting force, commanded by Franz Hipper, consisted of five battlecruisers, five light cruisers and 30 torpedo-boats. The Germans had no equivalent to ''Engadine'' and no [[aircraft|heavier-than-air aircraft]] to operate with the fleet but had the Imperial German Naval Airship Service's force of [[rigid airship]]s available to patrol the North Sea.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nAll of the battleships and battlecruisers on both sides carried [[torpedo]]es of various sizes, as did the lighter craft.<ref name=Camp-26/> The British battleships carried three or four underwater torpedo tubes. The battlecruisers carried from two to five. All were either 18-inch or 21-inch diameter. The German battleships carried five or six underwater torpedo tubes in three sizes from 18 to 21 inch and the battlecruisers carried four or five tubes.{{citation needed|date = February 2017}}\n\nThe German battle fleet was hampered by the slow speed and relatively poor armament of the six pre-dreadnoughts of II Squadron, which limited maximum fleet speed to {{convert|18|kn}}, compared to maximum British fleet speed of {{convert|21|kn}}.<ref name=Camp-16>{{cite book|title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=16–19}}</ref> On the British side, the eight armoured cruisers were deficient in both speed and armour protection.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=22}}</ref> Both of these obsolete squadrons were notably vulnerable to attacks by more modern enemy ships.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n==Battlecruiser action==\nThe route of the British battlecruiser fleet took it through the patrol sector allocated to ''U-32''. After receiving the order to commence the operation, the U-boat moved to a position {{convert|80|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} east of May Island at dawn on 31 May. At 03:40, it sighted the cruisers {{HMS|Galatea|1914|6}} and {{HMS|Phaeton|1914|2}} leaving the Forth at {{convert|18|kn}}. It launched one torpedo at the leading cruiser at a range of {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, but its periscope jammed 'up', giving away the position of the submarine as it manoeuvred to fire a second. The lead cruiser turned away to dodge the torpedo, while the second turned towards the submarine, attempting to ram. ''U-32'' [[crash dive]]d, and on raising its periscope at 04:10 saw two battlecruisers (the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron) heading south-east. They were too far away to attack, but ''[[Captain lieutenant|Kapitänleutnant]]'' von Spiegel reported the sighting of two battleships and two cruisers to Germany.<ref>Tarrant pp. 65–66</ref>\n\n''U-66'' was also supposed to be patrolling off the Firth of Forth but had been forced north to a position {{convert|60|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} off Peterhead by patrolling British vessels. This now brought it into contact with the 2nd Battle Squadron, coming from the Moray Firth. At 05:00, it had to crash dive when the cruiser {{HMS|Duke of Edinburgh||2}} appeared from the mist heading toward it. It was followed by another cruiser, {{HMS|Boadicea|1908|2}}, and eight battleships. ''U-66'' got within {{convert|350|yd|m|abbr=on}} of the battleships preparing to fire, but was forced to dive by an approaching destroyer and missed the opportunity. At 06:35, it reported eight battleships and cruisers heading north.<ref>Tarrant pp. 66–67</ref>\n\nThe courses reported by both submarines were incorrect, because they reflected one leg of a zigzag being used by British ships to avoid submarines. Taken with a wireless intercept of more ships leaving Scapa Flow earlier in the night, they created the impression in the German High Command that the British fleet, whatever it was doing, was split into separate sections moving apart, which was precisely as the Germans wished to meet it.<ref>Tarrant p. 67</ref>\n\nJellicoe's ships proceeded to their rendezvous undamaged and undiscovered. However, he was now misled by an Admiralty [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] report advising that the German main battle fleet was still in port.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=28–29}}</ref> The Director of Operations Division, Rear Admiral [[Thomas Jackson (Royal Navy officer)|Thomas Jackson]], had asked the intelligence division, [[Room 40]], for the current location of German call sign DK, used by Admiral Scheer. They had replied that it was currently transmitting from [[Wilhelmshaven]]. It was known to the intelligence staff that Scheer deliberately used a different call sign when at sea, but no one asked for this information or explained the reason behind the query – to locate the German fleet.<ref>Marder III pp. 41–42</ref>\n\nThe German battlecruisers cleared the minefields surrounding the [[Amrum]] swept channel by 09:00. They then proceeded north-west, passing {{convert|35|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} west of the [[Horns Rev|Horn's Reef]] lightship heading for the [[Fisher Bank|Little Fisher Bank]] at the mouth of the Skagerrak. The High Seas Fleet followed some {{convert|50|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} behind. The battlecruisers were in line ahead, with the four cruisers of the II scouting group plus supporting torpedo boats ranged in an arc {{convert|8|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} ahead and to either side. The IX torpedo boat flotilla formed close support immediately surrounding the battlecruisers. The High Seas Fleet similarly adopted a line-ahead formation, with close screening by torpedo boats to either side and a further screen of five cruisers surrounding the column {{convert|5|-|8|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} away. The wind had finally moderated so that Zeppelins could be used, and by 11:30 five had been sent out: ''L14'' to the Skagerrak, ''L23'' {{convert|240|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} east of Noss Head in the Pentland Firth, ''L21'' {{convert|120|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} off Peterhead, ''L9'' {{convert|100|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} off Sunderland, and ''L16'' {{convert|80|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} east of Flamborough Head.

Had the courses remained unchanged, Beatty would have passed between the two German fleets, {{convert|40|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} south of the battlecruisers and {{convert|20|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} north of the High Seas Fleet at around 16:30, possibly trapping his ships just as the German plan envisioned. His orders were to stop his scouting patrol when he reached a point {{convert|260|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} east of Britain and then turn north to meet Jellicoe, which he did at this time. Beatty's ships were divided into three columns, with the two battlecruiser squadrons leading in parallel lines {{convert|3|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} apart. The 5th Battle Squadron was stationed {{convert|5|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} to the north-west, on the side furthest away from any expected enemy contact, while a screen of cruisers and destroyers was spread south-east of the battlecruisers. After the turn, the 5th Battle Squadron was now leading the British ships in the westernmost column, and Beatty's squadron was centre and rearmost, with the 2nd BCS to the west.<ref>Tarrant pp. 70–71</ref>\n\n[[File:Jutland battlecruiser action.png|400px|thumb|(1) 15:22&nbsp;hrs, Hipper sights Beatty. <br/>(2) 15:48&nbsp;hrs, First shots fired by Hipper's squadron.<br/>(3) 16:00&nbsp;hrs-16:05&nbsp;hrs, ''Indefatigable'' explodes, leaving two survivors. <br/>(4) 16:25&nbsp;hrs, ''Queen Mary'' explodes, nine survive. <br/>(5) 16:45&nbsp;hrs, Beatty's battlecruisers move out of range of Hipper.<br/>(6) 16:54&nbsp;hrs, Evan-Thomas's battleships turn north behind Beatty.]]\n\nAt 14:20 on 31 May, despite heavy haze and [[Scud (cloud)|scuds]] of fog giving poor visibility,<ref name=\":0\" /> scouts from Beatty's force reported enemy ships to the south-east; the British light units, investigating a neutral Danish [[Steamboat|steamer]] (''N J Fjord''), which was stopped between the two fleets, had found two German destroyers engaged on the same mission ({{SMS|B109||2}} and {{SMS|B110||2}}). The first shots of the battle were fired at 14:28 when {{HMS|Galatea|1914|6}} and {{HMS|Phaeton|1914|2}} of the British 1st Light [[Cruiser Squadron]] opened on the German torpedo boats, which withdrew toward their approaching light cruisers. At 14:36, the Germans scored the first hit of the battle when {{SMS|Elbing||6}}, of Rear-Admiral [[Friedrich Boedicker]]'s Scouting Group II, hit her British counterpart ''Galatea'' at extreme range.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=31}}</ref>\n\nBeatty began to move his battlecruisers and supporting forces south-eastwards and then east to cut the German ships off from their base and ordered ''Engadine'' to launch a [[seaplane]] to try to get more information about the size and location of the German forces. This was the first time in history that a carrier-based aeroplane was used for reconnaissance in naval combat. ''Engadine''{{'}}s aircraft did locate and report some German light cruisers just before 15:30 and came under anti-aircraft gunfire but attempts to relay reports from the aeroplane failed.<ref name=Camp-35>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=35}}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for Beatty, his initial course changes at 14:32 were not received by [[Hugh Evan-Thomas|Sir Hugh Evan-Thomas's]] 5th Battle Squadron (the distance being too great to read his flags), because the battlecruiser {{HMS|Tiger|1913|6}}—the last ship in his column—was no longer in a position where she could relay signals by searchlight to Evan-Thomas, as she had previously been ordered to do. Whereas before the north turn, ''Tiger'' had been the closest ship to Evan-Thomas, she was now further away than Beatty in ''Lion''. Matters were aggravated because Evan-Thomas had not been briefed regarding standing orders within Beatty's squadron, as his squadron normally operated with the Grand Fleet. Fleet ships were expected to obey movement orders precisely and not deviate from them. Beatty's standing instructions expected his officers to use their initiative and keep station with the flagship.<ref>'Marder' III p. 55</ref> As a result, the four {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|battleship|1}}s—which were the fastest and most heavily armed in the world at that time—remained on the previous course for several minutes, ending up {{convert|10|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} behind rather than five.<ref>{{cite book|title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=32}}</ref> Beatty also had the opportunity during the previous hours to concentrate his forces, and no reason not to do so, whereas he steamed ahead at full speed, faster than the battleships could manage. Dividing the force had serious consequences for the British, costing them what would have been an overwhelming advantage in ships and firepower during the first half-hour of the coming battle.<ref name=Camp-35/>\n\nWith visibility favouring the Germans, Hipper's battlecruisers at 15:22, steaming approximately north-west, sighted Beatty's squadron at a range of about {{convert|15|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}}, while Beatty's forces did not identify Hipper's battlecruisers until 15:30. <span style=\"background: lightblue\">(position 1 on map)</span>. At 15:45, Hipper turned south-east to lead Beatty toward Scheer, who was {{convert|46|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} south-east with the main force of the High Seas Fleet.<ref>{{cite book|title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=34–35}}</ref>\n\n===Run to the south===\nBeatty's conduct during the next 15 minutes has received a great deal of criticism, as his ships out-ranged and outnumbered the German squadron, yet he held his fire for over 10 minutes with the German ships in range. He also failed to use the time available to rearrange his battlecruisers into a fighting formation, with the result that they were still manoeuvring when the battle started.<ref>Brooks pp. 234–237</ref>\n\nAt 15:48, with the opposing forces roughly parallel at {{convert|15000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, with the British to the south-west of the Germans (i.e., on the right side), Hipper opened fire, followed by the British ships as their guns came to bear upon targets <span style=\"background:lightblue\">(position 2)</span>. Thus began the opening phase of the battlecruiser action, known as the ''Run to the South'', in which the British chased the Germans, and Hipper intentionally led Beatty toward Scheer. During the first minutes of the ensuing battle, all the British ships except ''Princess Royal'' fired far over their German opponents, due to adverse visibility conditions, before finally getting the range. Only ''Lion'' and ''Princess Royal'' had settled into formation, so the other four ships were hampered in aiming by their own turning. Beatty was to windward of Hipper, and therefore funnel and gun smoke from his own ships tended to obscure his targets, while Hipper's smoke blew clear. Also, the eastern sky was overcast and the grey German ships were indistinct and difficult to range.<ref>{{cite book|title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=38–39}}</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Lion (1910).jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Beatty's]] flagship ''Lion'' burning after being hit by a salvo from ''Lützow'']]\n[[File:HMS Indefatigable sinking.jpg|thumb|left|250px|HMS ''Indefatigable'' sinking after being struck by shells from the German battlecruiser ''Von der Tann'']]\n\nBeatty had ordered his ships to engage in a line, one British ship engaging with one German and his [[flagship]] {{HMS|Lion|1910|6}} doubling on the German flagship {{SMS|Lützow||6}}. However, due to another mistake with signalling by flag, and possibly because ''Queen Mary'' and ''Tiger'' were unable to see the German lead ship because of smoke,<ref>Brooks p. 239</ref> the second German ship, ''Derfflinger'', was left un-engaged and free to fire without disruption. {{SMS|Moltke||6}} drew fire from two of Beatty's battlecruisers, but still fired with great accuracy during this time, hitting ''Tiger'' 9 times in the first 12 minutes. The Germans drew first blood. Aided by superior visibility, Hipper's five battlecruisers quickly registered hits on three of the six British battlecruisers. Seven minutes passed before the British managed to score their first hit.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=39–41}}</ref>\n\nThe first near-kill of the Run to the South occurred at 16:00, when a {{convert|30.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} shell from ''Lützow'' wrecked the \"Q\" turret amidships on Beatty's flagship ''Lion''. Dozens of crewmen were instantly killed, but far larger destruction was averted when the mortally wounded turret commander – Major [[Francis John William Harvey|Francis Harvey]] of the [[Royal Marines]] – promptly ordered the magazine doors shut and the magazine flooded. This prevented a magazine explosion at 16:28, when a flash fire ignited ready cordite charges beneath the turret and killed everyone in the chambers outside \"Q\" magazine. ''Lion'' was saved.<ref>{{cite book|title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=64–66}}</ref> {{HMS|Indefatigable|1909|6}} was not so lucky; at 16:02, just 14 minutes into the gunnery exchange, she was hit aft by three {{convert|28|cm|in|abbr=on}} shells from {{SMS|Von der Tann||6}}, causing damage sufficient to knock her out of line and detonating \"X\" magazine aft. Soon after, despite the near-maximum range, ''Von der Tann'' put another {{convert|28|cm|in|abbr=on}} shell on ''Indefatigable''{{'}}s \"A\" turret forward. The plunging shells probably pierced the thin upper armour, and seconds later ''Indefatigable'' was ripped apart by another magazine explosion, sinking immediately with her crew of 1,019 officers and men, leaving only two survivors.<ref>{{cite book|title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=60–61}}</ref> <span style=\"background:lightblue\">(position 3)</span>.\n\nHipper's position deteriorated somewhat by 16:15 as the 5th Battle Squadron finally came into range, so that he had to contend with gunfire from the four battleships astern as well as Beatty's five remaining battlecruisers to starboard. But he knew his baiting mission was close to completion, as his force was rapidly closing with Scheer's main body. At 16:08, the lead battleship of the 5th Battle Squadron, {{HMS|Barham|04|6}}, caught up with Hipper and opened fire at extreme range, scoring a {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on}} hit on ''Von der Tann'' within 60 seconds. Still, it was 16:15 before all the battleships of the 5th were able to fully engage at long range.<ref>{{cite book|title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=49}}</ref>\n\nAt 16:25, the battlecruiser action intensified again when {{HMS|Queen Mary||6}} was hit by what may have been a combined salvo from ''Derfflinger'' and {{SMS|Seydlitz||2}}; she disintegrated when both forward magazines exploded, sinking with all but nine of her 1,275 man crew lost.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=62–64}}</ref> <span style=\"background:lightblue\">(position 4)</span>. <!-- Campbell p. 47 says 20 survivors picked up but that would mean a crew of 1,286 since he says 1,266 were lost. -->Commander von Hase, the first gunnery officer aboard ''Derfflingler'', noted:\n\n{{bquote|The enemy was shooting superbly.

This was the first news that Beatty and Jellicoe had that Scheer and his battle fleet were even at sea. Simultaneously, an all-out destroyer action raged in the space between the opposing battlecruiser forces, as British and German destroyers fought with each other and attempted to torpedo the larger enemy ships. Each side fired many torpedoes, but both battlecruiser forces turned away from the attacks and all escaped harm except ''Seydlitz'', which was hit forward at 16:57 by a torpedo fired by the British destroyer {{HMS|Petard|1916|6}}. Though taking on water, ''Seydlitz'' maintained speed. The destroyer {{HMS|Nestor|1915|6}}, under the command of [[Edward Bingham|Captain Barry Bingham]], led the British attacks. The British disabled the German torpedo boat {{SMS|V27||2}}, which the Germans soon abandoned and sank, and ''Petard'' then torpedoed and sank {{SMS|V29||2}}, her second score of the day. {{SMS|S35||2}} and {{SMS|V26||2}} rescued the crews of their sunken sister ships. But ''Nestor'' and another British destroyer – {{HMS|Nomad|1916|6}} – were immobilised by shell hits, and were later sunk by Scheer's passing dreadnoughts. Bingham was rescued, and won the Victoria Cross for his leadership in the destroyer action.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=50–56}}</ref>\n\n===Run to the north===\nAs soon as he himself sighted the vanguard of Scheer's distant battleship line {{convert|12|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} away, at 16:40, Beatty turned his battlecruiser force 180°, heading north to draw the Germans toward Jellicoe.<ref>{{cite book|title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=52}}</ref> <span style=\"background:lightblue\">(position 5)</span>. Beatty's withdrawal toward Jellicoe is called the \"Run to the North\", in which the tables turned and the Germans chased the British. Because Beatty once again failed to signal his intentions adequately, the battleships of the 5th Battle Squadron – which were too far behind to read his flags – found themselves passing the battlecruisers on an opposing course and heading directly toward the approaching main body of the High Seas Fleet. At 16:48, at extreme range, Scheer's leading battleships opened fire.<ref name=Camp-54>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=54}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, at 16:47, having received Goodenough's signal and knowing that Beatty was now leading the German battle fleet north to him, Jellicoe signalled to his own forces that the fleet action they had waited so long for was finally imminent; at 16:51, by radio, he informed the Admiralty so in London.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=58–59}}</ref>\n\nThe difficulties of the 5th Battle Squadron were compounded when Beatty gave the order to Evan-Thomas to \"turn in succession\" (rather than \"turn together\") at 16:48 as the battleships passed him. Evan-Thomas acknowledged the signal, but [[Lieutenant-Commander]] [[Ralph Seymour (naval officer)|Ralph Seymour]], Beatty's [[flag lieutenant]], aggravated the situation when he did not haul down the flags (to execute the signal) for some minutes. At 16:55, when the 5BS had moved within range of the enemy battleships, Evan-Thomas issued his own flag command warning his squadron to expect sudden manoeuvres and to follow his lead, before starting to turn on his own initiative. The order to turn in succession would have resulted in all four ships turning in the same patch of sea as they reached it one by one, giving the High Seas Fleet repeated opportunity with ample time to find the proper range. However, the captain of the trailing ship ({{HMS|Malaya}}) turned early, mitigating the adverse results.<ref name=Camp-54/><ref>Massie, pp. 600–601</ref>\n\nFor the next hour, the 5th Battle Squadron acted as Beatty's rearguard, drawing fire from all the German ships within range, while by 17:10 Beatty had deliberately eased his own squadron out of range of Hipper's now-superior battlecruiser force.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=96–97}}</ref> Since visibility and firepower now favoured the Germans, there was no incentive for Beatty to risk further battlecruiser losses when his own gunnery could not be effective. Illustrating the imbalance, Beatty's battlecruisers did not score any hits on the Germans in this phase until 17:45,<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=135 }}</ref> but they had rapidly received five more before he opened the range (four on ''Lion'', of which three were by ''Lützow'', and one on ''Tiger'' by ''Seydlitz'').<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=124–125, 145}}</ref> Now the only targets the Germans could reach, the ships of the 5th Battle Squadron, received simultaneous fire from Hipper's battlecruisers to the east (which HMS ''Barham'' and {{HMS|Valiant|1914|2}} engaged) and Scheer's leading battleships to the south-east (which {{HMS|Warspite|03|6}} and {{HMS|Malaya||2}} engaged).<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=100}}</ref> Three took hits: ''Barham'' (four by ''Derfflinger''), ''Warspite'' (two by ''Seydlitz''), and ''Malaya'' (seven by the German battleships). Only ''Valiant'' was unscathed.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=126–133}}</ref>\n\nThe four battleships were far better suited to take this sort of pounding than the battlecruisers, and none were lost, though ''Malaya'' suffered heavy damage, an ammunition fire, and heavy crew casualties. At the same time, the {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on}} fire of the four British ships was accurate and effective. As the two British squadrons headed north at top speed, eagerly chased by the entire German fleet, the 5th Battle Squadron scored 13 hits on the enemy battlecruisers (four on ''Lützow'', three on ''Derfflinger'', six on ''Seydlitz'') and five on battleships (although only one, on {{SMS|Markgraf||6}}, did any serious damage).<ref>{{cite book|title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=134–145}}</ref> <span style=\"background:lightblue\">(position 6)</span>.\n\n===The fleets converge===\nJellicoe was now aware that full fleet engagement was nearing, but had insufficient information on the position and course of the Germans. To assist Beatty, early in the battle at about 16:05, Jellicoe had ordered [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Horace Hood]]'s [[3rd Battlecruiser Squadron]] to speed ahead to find and support Beatty's force, and Hood was now racing SSE well in advance of Jellicoe's northern force.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=59}}</ref> [[Sir Robert Arbuthnot, 4th Baronet|Rear-Admiral Arbuthnot]]'s 1st Cruiser Squadron patrolled the van of Jellicoe's main battleship force as it advanced steadily to the south-east.\n\nAt 17:33, the armoured cruiser {{HMS|Black Prince|1904|6}} of Arbuthnot's squadron, on the far southwest flank of Jellicoe's force, came within view of {{HMS|Falmouth|1910|6}}, which was about {{convert|5|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} ahead of Beatty with the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron, establishing the first visual link between the converging bodies of the Grand Fleet.<ref>{{cite book|title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=118}}</ref> At 17:38, the scout cruiser {{HMS|Chester|1915|6}}, screening Hood's oncoming battlecruisers, was intercepted by the van of the German scouting forces under Rear-Admiral Boedicker.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=111}}</ref>\n\nHeavily outnumbered by Boedicker's four light cruisers, ''Chester'' was pounded before being relieved by Hood's heavy units, which swung westward for that purpose. Hood's flagship {{HMS|Invincible|1907|6}} disabled the light cruiser {{SMS|Wiesbaden||6}} shortly after 17:56. ''Wiesbaden'' became a sitting target for most of the British fleet during the next hour, but remained afloat and fired some torpedoes at the passing enemy battleships from long range. Meanwhile, Boedicker's other ships turned toward Hipper and Scheer in the mistaken belief that Hood was leading a larger force of British capital ships from the north and east. A chaotic destroyer action in mist and smoke ensued as German torpedo boats attempted to blunt the arrival of this new formation, but Hood's battlecruisers dodged all the torpedoes fired at them. In this action, after leading a torpedo counter-attack, the British destroyer {{HMS|Shark|1912|6}} was disabled, but continued to return fire at numerous passing enemy ships for the next hour.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=111–115}}</ref>\n\n==Fleet action==\n\n===Deployment===\n\n[[File:Jutland fleet action.png|right|thumb|(1) 18:00 Scouting forces rejoin their respective fleets.<br/>(2) 18:15 British fleet deploys into battle line <br/>(3) 18:30 German fleet under fire turns away<br/>(4) 19:00 German fleet turns back<br/>(5) 19:15 German fleet turns away for second time <br/>(6) 20:00<br/>(7) 21:00 Nightfall: Jellicoe assumes night cruising formation]]\nIn the meantime, Beatty and Evan-Thomas had resumed their engagement with Hipper's battlecruisers, this time with the visual conditions to their advantage. With several of his ships damaged, Hipper turned back toward Scheer at around 18:00, just as Beatty's flagship ''Lion'' was finally sighted from Jellicoe's flagship ''Iron Duke''. Jellicoe twice demanded the latest position of the German battlefleet from Beatty, who could not see the German battleships and failed to respond to the question until 18:14. Meanwhile, Jellicoe received confused sighting reports of varying accuracy and limited usefulness from light cruisers and battleships on the starboard (southern) flank of his force.<ref name=Camp-120>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=120–121}}</ref>\n\nJellicoe was in a worrying position. He needed to know the location of the German fleet to judge when and how to deploy his battleships from their cruising formation (six columns of four ships each) into a single battle line. The deployment could be on either the westernmost or the easternmost column, and had to be carried out before the Germans arrived; but early deployment could mean losing any chance of a decisive encounter. Deploying to the west would bring his fleet closer to Scheer, gaining valuable time as dusk approached, but the Germans might arrive before the manoeuvre was complete. Deploying to the east would take the force away from Scheer, but Jellicoe's ships might be able to [[crossing the T|cross the \"T\"]], and visibility would strongly favour British gunnery – Scheer's forces would be silhouetted against the setting sun to the west, while the Grand Fleet would be indistinct against the dark skies to the north and east, and would be hidden by reflection of the low sunlight off intervening haze and smoke. Deployment would take twenty irreplaceable minutes, and the fleets were closing at full speed. In one of the most critical and difficult tactical command decisions of the entire war, Jellicoe ordered deployment to the east at 18:15.<ref name=Camp-120/><ref>{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=612–613}}</ref>\n\n===Windy Corner===\nMeanwhile, Hipper had rejoined Scheer, and the combined High Seas Fleet was heading north, directly toward Jellicoe. Scheer had no indication that Jellicoe was at sea, let alone that he was bearing down from the north-west, and was distracted by the intervention of Hood's ships to his north and east. Beatty's four surviving battlecruisers were now crossing the van of the British dreadnoughts to join Hood's three battlecruisers; at this time, Arbuthnot's flagship, the armoured cruiser {{HMS|Defence|1907|6}}, and her squadron-mate {{HMS|Warrior|1905|6}} both charged across Beatty's bows, and ''Lion'' narrowly avoided a collision with ''Warrior''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=115}}</ref> Nearby, numerous British light cruisers and destroyers on the south-western flank of the deploying battleships were also crossing each other's courses in attempts to reach their proper stations, often barely escaping collisions, and under fire from some of the approaching German ships. This period of peril and heavy traffic attending the merger and deployment of the British forces later became known as \"Windy Corner\".<ref>Massie, p. 614</ref>\n\nArbuthnot was attracted by the drifting hull of the crippled ''Wiesbaden''. With ''Warrior'', ''Defence'' closed in for the kill, only to blunder right into the gun sights of Hipper's and Scheer's oncoming capital ships. ''Defence'' was deluged by heavy-calibre gunfire from many German battleships, which detonated her magazines in a spectacular explosion viewed by most of the deploying Grand Fleet. She sank with all hands (903 officers and men). ''Warrior'' was also hit badly, but was spared destruction by a mishap to the nearby battleship ''Warspite''. ''Warspite'' had her steering gear overheat and jam under heavy load at high speed as the 5th Battle Squadron made a turn to the north at 18:19.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=153, 179}}</ref> Steaming at top speed in wide circles, ''Warspite'' appeared as a juicy target to the German dreadnoughts and took 13 hits, inadvertently drawing fire from the hapless ''Warrior''. ''Warspite'' was brought back under control and survived the onslaught, but was badly damaged, had to reduce speed, and withdrew northward; later (at 21:07), she was ordered back to port by Evan-Thomas.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=259}}</ref> ''Warspite'' went on to a long and illustrious career, serving also in World War II. ''Warrior'', on the other hand, was abandoned and sank the next day after her crew was taken off at 08:25 on 1 June by ''Engadine'', which towed the sinking armoured cruiser {{convert|100|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} during the night.<ref>{{cite book|title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=319}}</ref>\n\n[[File:InvincibleBlowingUpJutland1916.jpg|thumb|left|''Invincible'' blowing up after being struck by shells from ''Lützow'' and ''Derfflinger'']]\nAs ''Defence'' sank and ''Warspite'' circled, at about 18:19, Hipper moved within range of Hood's 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron, but was still also within range of Beatty's ships. At first, visibility favoured the British: {{HMS|Indomitable|1907|6}} hit ''Derfflinger'' three times and ''Seydlitz'' once,<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=185–187}}</ref> while ''Lützow'' quickly took 10 hits from ''Lion'', {{HMS|Inflexible|1907|2}} and ''Invincible'', including two below-waterline hits forward by ''Invincible'' that would ultimately doom Hipper's flagship.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=183}}</ref> But at 18:30, ''Invincible'' abruptly appeared as a clear target before ''Lützow'' and ''Derfflinger''. The two German ships then fired three salvoes each at ''Invincible'', and sank her in 90 seconds.

The officers on the lead German battleships, and Scheer himself, were taken completely by surprise when they emerged from drifting clouds of smoky mist to suddenly find themselves facing the massed firepower of the entire Grand Fleet main battle line, which they did not know was even at sea.<ref name=Massie-621>{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |page=621}}</ref> Jellicoe's flagship ''Iron Duke'' quickly scored seven hits on the lead German dreadnought, {{SMS|König||6}} but in this brief exchange, which lasted only minutes, as few as 10 of the Grand Fleet's 24 dreadnoughts actually opened fire.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=187–188}}</ref> The Germans were hampered by poor visibility, in addition to being in an unfavourable tactical position, just as Jellicoe had intended. Realising he was heading into a death trap, Scheer ordered his fleet to turn and disengage at 18:33. Under a pall of smoke and mist, Scheer's forces succeeded in disengaging by an expertly executed 180° turn in unison (\"battle about turn to starboard\", German ''Gefechtskehrtwendung nach Steuerbord''), which was a well-practised emergency manoeuvre of the High Seas Fleet.<ref>{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |page=622}}</ref> Scheer declared:\n\n{{bquote |It was now obvious that we were confronted by a large portion of the English fleet.

Starting at 18:40, battleships at the rear of Jellicoe's line were in fact sighting and avoiding torpedoes, and at 18:54 {{HMS|Marlborough|1912|6}} was hit by a torpedo (probably from the disabled ''Wiesbaden''), which reduced her speed to {{convert|16|kn}}.<ref>{{cite book|title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=167}}</ref> Meanwhile, Scheer, knowing that it was not yet dark enough to escape and that his fleet would suffer terribly in a stern chase, doubled back to the east at 18:55.

By 19:15, Jellicoe had crossed Scheer's \"T\" again. This time his arc of fire was tighter and deadlier, causing severe damage to the German battleships, particularly Rear-Admiral Behncke's leading 3rd Squadron (SMS ''König'', {{SMS|Grosser Kurfürst|1913|2}}, ''Markgraf'', and {{SMS|Kaiser|1911|2}} all being hit, along with {{SMS|Helgoland||6}} of the 1st Squadron),<ref name=Camp-246>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=246}}</ref> while on the British side, only the battleship {{HMS|Colossus|1910|6}} was hit (twice, by {{SMS|Seydlitz||6}} but with little damage done).<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=218}}</ref>\n\nAt 19:17, for the second time in less than an hour, Scheer turned his outnumbered and out-gunned fleet to the west using the \"battle about turn\" (German: ''Gefechtskehrtwendung''), but this time it was executed only with difficulty, as the High Seas Fleet's lead squadrons began to lose formation under concentrated gunfire.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=200–201}}</ref> To deter a British chase, Scheer ordered a major torpedo attack by his destroyers and a potentially sacrificial charge by Scouting Group I's four remaining battlecruisers.

In the first of many surprise encounters by darkened ships at point-blank range, ''Southampton'', Commodore Goodenough's flagship, which had scouted so proficiently, was heavily damaged in action with a German Scouting Group composed of light cruisers, but managed to torpedo {{SMS|Frauenlob||6}}, which went down at 22:23 with all hands (320 officers and men).<ref>{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=639–640}}</ref>\n\nFrom 23:20 to approximately 02:15, several British destroyer [[flotilla]]s launched torpedo attacks on the German battle fleet in a series of violent and chaotic engagements at extremely short range (often under {{convert|0.5|mi|km|abbr=on}}).<ref name=Massie-642-647>{{cite book|title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=642–645, pp. 647–648}}</ref> At the cost of five destroyers sunk and some others damaged, they managed to torpedo the light cruiser {{SMS|Rostock||6}}, which sank several hours later, and the pre-dreadnought {{SMS|Pommern||6}}, which blew up and sank with all hands (839 officers and men) at 03:10 during the last wave of attacks before dawn.<ref name=Massie-642-647/> Three of the British destroyers collided in the chaos, and the German battleship {{SMS|Nassau||6}} rammed the British destroyer {{HMS|Spitfire|1912|6}}, blowing away most of the British ship's superstructure merely with the muzzle blast of its big guns, which could not be aimed low enough to hit the ship.

All but ''Moresby'' in the rear followed, as through the gloom she sighted what she thought were four pre-dreadnought battleships {{convert|2|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} away. She hoisted a flag signal indicating that the enemy was to the west and then closed to firing range, letting off a torpedo set for high running at 02:37, then veering off to rejoin her flotilla.

Had the other messages been forwarded, which confirmed the information received at 23:15, or had British ships reported accurately sightings and engagements with German destroyers, cruisers and battleships, then Jellicoe could have altered course to intercept Scheer at the Horns Reef. The unsent intercepted messages had been duly filed by the junior officer left on duty that night, who failed to appreciate their significance.<ref>Marder pp. 148–151</ref> By the time Jellicoe finally learned of Scheer's whereabouts at 04:15, the German fleet was too far away to catch and it was clear that the battle could no longer be resumed.\n\n==Outcome==\n\n===Reporting===\nAt midday on 2 June, German authorities released a press statement claiming a victory, including the destruction of a battleship, two battlecruisers, two armoured cruisers, a light cruiser, a submarine and several destroyers, for the loss of ''Pommern'' and ''Wiesbaden''. News that ''Lützow'', ''Elbing'' and ''Rostock'' had been scuttled was withheld, on the grounds this information would not be known to the enemy. The victory of the Skagerrak was celebrated in the press, children were given a holiday and the nation celebrated. The Kaiser announced a new chapter in world history. Post-war, the official German history hailed the battle as a victory and it continued to be celebrated until after World War II.<ref>Tarrant pp. 274–276</ref>\n\nIn Britain, the first official news came from German wireless broadcasts. Ships began to arrive in port, their crews sending messages to friends and relatives both of their survival and the loss of some 6,000 others. Authorities considered suppressing the news, but it had already spread widely. Some crews coming ashore found rumours had already reported them dead to relatives, while others were jeered for the defeat they had suffered.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.familyletters.co.uk/21-june-1916-paul-to-ted/|title=21 June 1916 – Paul to Ted|date=2016-06-01|newspaper=familyletters.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-13}}</ref> At 19:00 on 2 June, the Admiralty released a statement based on information from Jellicoe containing the bare news of losses on each side.

On 3 June, the Admiralty issued a further statement expanding on German losses, and another the following day with exaggerated claims. However, on 7 June the German admission of the losses of  ''Lützow'' and ''Rostock'' started to redress the sense of the battle as a loss. International perception of the battle began to change towards a qualified British victory, the German attempt to change the balance of power in the North Sea having been repulsed. In July, bad news from the ''[[Battle of the Somme|Somme campaign]]'' swept concern over Jutland from the British consciousness.<ref>Steele & Hart pp. 421–422</ref>\n\n===Assessments===\n\n[[File:SMS Seydlitz damage.jpg|thumb|left|SMS ''Seydlitz'' was heavily damaged in the battle, hit by twenty-one main calibre shells, several secondary calibre and one torpedo. 98 men were killed and 55 injured.]]\nAt Jutland, the Germans, with a 99-strong fleet, sank {{convert|115000|LT|t|abbr=on}} of British ships, while a 151-strong British fleet sank {{convert|62000|LT|t|abbr=on}} of German ships. The British lost 6,094 seamen; the Germans 2,551. Several other ships were badly damaged, such as {{HMS|Lion|1910|2}} and {{SMS|Seydlitz||2}}.\n\nAs of the summer of 1916, the High Seas Fleet's strategy was to whittle away the numerical advantage of the Royal Navy by bringing its full strength to bear against isolated squadrons of enemy capital ships whilst declining to be drawn into a general fleet battle until it had achieved something resembling parity in heavy ships. In tactical terms, the High Seas Fleet had clearly inflicted significantly greater losses on the Grand Fleet than it had suffered itself at Jutland and the Germans never had any intention of attempting to hold the site of the battle,<ref name=\"suth\">{{cite book |author=Sutherland & Canwell |title=The Battle of Jutland |publisher=Pen & Sword |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-84415-529-3}}</ref> so some historians support the German claim of victory at Jutland.\n\nHowever, Scheer seems to have quickly realised that further battles with a similar rate of attrition would exhaust the High Seas Fleet long before it reduced the Grand Fleet.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}  Further, after the 19 August advance was nearly intercepted by the Grand Fleet, he no longer believed that it would be possible to trap a single squadron of Royal Navy warships without having the Grand Fleet intervene before he could return to port. Therefore, the High Seas Fleet abandoned its forays into the North Sea and turned its attention to the Baltic for most of 1917 whilst Scheer switched tactics against Britain to unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic.\n\nAt a strategic level, the outcome has been the subject of a huge amount of literature with no clear consensus. The battle was widely viewed as indecisive in the immediate aftermath and this view remains influential.\n\nDespite numerical superiority, the British had been disappointed in their hopes for a decisive victory {{citation needed|date=May 2016}} comparable to [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]] and the objective of the influential strategic doctrines of [[Alfred Mahan]]. The High Seas Fleet survived as a [[fleet in being]]. Most of its losses were made good within a month – even ''Seydlitz'', the most badly damaged ship to survive the battle, was repaired by October and officially back in service by November. However, the Germans had failed in their objective of destroying a substantial portion of the British Fleet, and no progress had been made towards the goal of allowing the High Seas Fleet to operate in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nSubsequently, there has been considerable support for the view of Jutland as a strategic victory for the British. While the British had not destroyed the German fleet and had lost more ships than their enemy, the Germans had retreated to harbour; at the end of the battle the British were in command of the area.\n\nThe German fleet would only sortie into the North Sea thrice more, with a [[Action of 19 August 1916|raid on 19 August]], one in October 1916 and another in April 1918. All three were unopposed by capital ships and quickly aborted as neither side were prepared to take the risks of mines and submarines.\n\nApart from these three abortive operations the High Seas Fleet – unwilling to risk another encounter with the British fleet – confined its activities to the Baltic Sea for the remainder of the war. Jellicoe issued an order prohibiting the Grand Fleet from steaming south of the line of Horns Reef owing to the threat of mines and U-boats.<ref>Massie, ''Castles'', p. 684</ref> A German naval expert, writing publicly about Jutland in November 1918, commented, \"Our Fleet losses were severe.

As a result, some German ships with only {{convert|8|in|cm|abbr=on}}-thick armour survived hits from {{convert|15|in|cm|adj=on}} projectiles. Had these shells penetrated the armour and then exploded, German losses would probably have been far greater.\n* Communication between ships and the British commander-in-chief were comparatively poor. For most of the battle, Jellicoe had no idea where the German ships were, even though British ships were in contact. They failed to report enemy positions, contrary to the Grand Fleet's Battle Plan. Some of the most important signalling was carried out solely by flag instead of wireless or using redundant methods to ensure communications—a questionable procedure, given the mixture of haze and smoke that obscured the battlefield, and a foreshadowing of similar failures by habit-bound and conservatively minded professional officers of rank to take advantage of new technology in World War II.\n\n====Shell performance====\nGerman [[Armour-piercing shot and shell|armour-piercing shells]] were far more effective than the British ones, which often failed to penetrate heavy armour.<ref>Campbell, pp. 386–387</ref> The issue particularly concerned shells striking at oblique angles, which became increasingly the case at long range.<ref>Marder III p. 170</ref> Germany had adopted [[trinitrotoluene]] (TNT) as the explosive filler for artillery shells in 1902, while the United Kingdom was still using a [[picric acid]] mixture (Lyddite). The shock of impact of a shell against armour often prematurely detonated Lyddite in advance of [[fuze]] function while TNT detonation could be delayed until after the shell had penetrated and the fuze had functioned in the vulnerable area behind the armour plate.<ref>Brown, pp. 151–152</ref>\n\nThe issue of poorly performing shells had been known to Jellicoe, who as Third Sea Lord from 1908 to 1910 had ordered new shells to be designed. However, the matter had not been followed through after his posting to sea and new shells had never been thoroughly tested.<ref>'Castles' p. 61.</ref> Beatty discovered the problem at a party aboard ''Lion'' a short time after the battle, when a Swedish Naval officer was present. He had recently visited Berlin, where the German navy had scoffed at how British shells had broken up on their ships' armour.<ref name=Castles668>'Castles' p. 668</ref> The question of shell effectiveness had also been raised after the [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Battle of Dogger Bank]], but no action had been taken.<ref name=\"Marder\">Marder III p. 171</ref> Hipper later commented, \"It was nothing but the poor quality of their bursting charges which saved us from disaster.\"<ref>'Castles' p. 671 citing Marder Vol. III p. 81</ref>\n\nAdmiral Dreyer, writing later about the battle, during which he had been captain of the British flagship ''Iron Duke'', estimated that effective shells as later introduced would have led to the sinking of six more German capital ships, based upon the actual number of hits achieved in the battle.<ref>Marder p. 169</ref> The system of testing shells, which remained in use up to 1944, meant that, statistically, a batch of shells of which 70% were faulty stood an even chance of being accepted. Indeed, even shells that failed this relatively mild test had still been issued to ships. Analysis of the test results afterwards by the Ordnance Board suggested the likelihood that 30–70% of shells would not have passed the standard penetration test specified by the Admiralty.<ref name=\"Marder\" />\n\nEfforts to replace the shells were initially resisted by the Admiralty, and action was not taken until Jellicoe became First Sea Lord in December 1916. As an initial response, the worst of the existing shells were withdrawn from ships in early 1917 and replaced from reserve supplies.<ref>Marder III, p. 215</ref> New shells were designed, but did not arrive until April 1918, and were never used in action.<ref name=Castles668/>\n\n====Battlecruiser losses====\nBritish battlecruisers were designed to chase and destroy enemy cruisers from out of the range of those ships. They were not designed to be [[ship of the line|ships of the line]] and exchange [[broadside]]s with the enemy. One German and three British battlecruisers were sunk—but none were destroyed by enemy shells penetrating the belt armour and detonating the magazines. Each of the British battlecruisers was penetrated through a turret roof and her magazines ignited by flash fires passing through the turret and shell-handling rooms.<ref>{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=666–667}}</ref> ''Lützow'' sustained 24 hits and her flooding could not be contained.

Of this there can be no question. But it is also undoubted that the gunnery of the German battle-cruisers in the early stages was of a very high standard.|Sir John Jellicoe|''Jellicoe's official despatch''<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.gwpda.org/naval/jut02.htm |title=Battle of Jutland - Jellicoe's Despatch |publisher=referencing ''Battle of Jutland - Official Despatches with Appendicies'', \"Presented to Parliament by Command of His Majesty, His Majesty's Stationary Office, 1920}}</ref>}}\n\nJellicoe and Beatty, as well as other senior officers, gave an impression that the loss of the battlecruisers was caused by weak armour, despite reports by two committees and earlier statements by Jellicoe and other senior officers that Cordite and its management were to blame. This led to calls for armour to be increased, and an additional {{convert|1|in|cm|abbr=on}} was placed over the relatively thin decks above magazines. To compensate for the increase in weight, ships had to carry correspondingly less fuel, water and other supplies. Whether or not thin deck armour was a potential weakness of British ships, the battle provided no evidence that it was the case. At least amongst the surviving ships, no enemy shell was found to have penetrated deck armour anywhere.<ref>Marder III p. 218</ref> The design of the new battlecruiser {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} (which had started building at the time of the battle) was altered to give her {{convert|5000|LT|t|abbr=on}} of additional armour.<ref>Marder III p. 219</ref>\n\n====Ammunition handling====\nBritish and German [[propellant]] charges differed in packaging, handling, and chemistry. The British propellant was of two types, MK1 and MD. The Mark 1 cordite had a formula of 37% nitrocellulose, 58% nitroglycerine, and 5% petroleum jelly. It was a good propellant but burned hot and caused an erosion problem in gun barrels. The petroleum jelly served as both a lubricant and a stabiliser. Cordite MD was developed to reduce barrel wear, its formula being 65% nitrocellulose, 30% nitroglycerine, and 5% petroleum jelly. While cordite MD solved the gun-barrel erosion issue, it did nothing to improve its storage properties, which were poor. Cordite was very sensitive to variations of temperature, and acid propagation/cordite deterioration would take place at a very rapid rate. Cordite MD also shed micro-dust particles of nitrocellulose and iron pyrite.<ref name=\"navweaps.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/index_tech/tech-100.htm|title=Naval Propellants – A Brief Overview|author=Tony DiGiulian|publisher=navweaps.com|accessdate=27 May 2014}}</ref>  While cordite propellant was manageable, it required a vigilant gunnery officer, strict cordite lot control, and frequent testing of the cordite lots in the ships' magazines.<ref name=\"worldwar1.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwar1.co.uk/grant.htm|title=Battle of Jutland, Memoir – World War 1 Naval Combat|publisher=worldwar1.co.uk|accessdate=27 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nBritish [[cordite]] propellant (when uncased and exposed in the silk bag) tended to burn violently, causing uncontrollable \"flash fires\" when ignited by nearby shell hits. In 1945, a test was conducted by the U.S.N. Bureau of Ordnance (Bulletin of Ordnance Information, No.245, pp.&nbsp;54–60)<ref name=\"warship\">{{cite web|url=http://www.warship.org/loss_of_hms_hood__part_3.htm#68 |title=Loss of HMS Hood&nbsp; Part 3 |publisher=warship.org |accessdate=27 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111072209/http://www.warship.org/loss_of_hms_hood__part_3.htm |archivedate=11 January 2015 }}</ref> testing the sensitivity of cordite to then-current U.S. Naval propellant powders against a measurable and repeatable flash source. It found that cordite would ignite at 530&nbsp;mm/22\" from the flash, the current U.S. powder at 120&nbsp;mm, /5\", and the U.S. flashless powder at 25&nbsp;mm./1\"/\n\nThis meant that about 75 times the propellant would immediately ignite when exposed to flash, as compared to the U.S. powder. British ships had inadequate protection against these flash fires. German propellant (''RP C/12'', handled in brass cartridge cases) was less vulnerable and less volatile in composition.<ref>Campbell, pp. 377–378</ref>  German propellants were not that different in composition from cordite—with one major exception: [[centralite]]. This was symmetrical Diethyl Diphenyl Urea, which served as a stabiliser that was superior to the petroleum jelly used in British practice. It stored better and burned but did not explode. Stored and used in brass cases, it proved much less sensitive to flash. RP C/12 was composed of 64.13% nitrocellulose, 29.77% nitroglycerine, 5.75% centralite, 0.25% magnesium oxide and 0.10% graphite.<ref name=\"navweaps.com\" />\n\nThe Royal Navy Battle Cruiser Fleet had also emphasised speed in ammunition handling over established safety protocol. In practice drills, cordite could not be supplied to the guns rapidly enough through the hoists and hatches. To bring up the propellant in good time to load for the next broadside, many safety doors were kept open that should have been shut to safeguard against flash fires. Bags of cordite were also stocked and kept locally, creating a total breakdown of safety design features. By staging charges in the chambers between the gun turret and magazine, the Royal Navy enhanced their rate of fire but left their ships vulnerable to chain reaction ammunition fires and magazine explosions.<ref name=\"worldwar1.co.uk\"/><ref>Campbell, pp. 371–372</ref> This 'bad safety habit' carried over into real battle practices.<ref name=\"worldwar1.co.uk\"/> Furthermore, the doctrine of a high rate of fire also led to the decision in 1913 to increase the supply of shells and cordite held on the British ships by 50%, for fear of running out of ammunition. When this exceeded the capacity of the ships' magazines, cordite was stored in insecure places.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lambert |title=Bloody Ships |page=36}}</ref>\n\nThe British cordite charges were stored two silk bags to a metal cylindrical container, with a 16-oz gunpowder igniter charge, which was covered with a thick paper wad, four charges being used on each projectile. The gun crews were removing the charges from their containers and removing the paper covering over the gunpowder igniter charges. The effect of having eight loads at the ready was to have {{convert|4|ST|kg|abbr=on}} of exposed explosive, with each charge leaking small amounts of gunpowder from the igniter bags. In effect, the gun crews had laid an explosive train from the turret to the magazines, and one shell hit to a battlecruiser turret was enough to end a ship.<ref>British Battlecruisers 1914–18, Lawrence Burr, Tony Bryan pp. 41–42</ref>\n\nA diving expedition during the summer of 2003 provided corroboration of this practice. It examined the wrecks of ''Invincible'', ''Queen Mary'', ''Defence'', and ''Lützow'' to investigate the cause of the British ships' tendency to suffer from internal explosions. From this evidence, a major part of the blame may be laid on lax handling of the cordite propellant for the shells of the main guns. The wreck of the ''Queen Mary'' revealed cordite containers stacked in the working chamber of the X turret instead of the magazine.<ref>British Battlecruisers 1914–18, Lawrence Burr, Tony Bryan p. 43</ref>\n\nThere was a further difference in the propellant itself. While the German ''RP C/12'' burned when exposed to fire, it did not explode, as opposed to cordite. ''RP C/12'' was extensively studied by the British and, after World War I, would form the basis of the later Cordite SC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNGER_projectiles.htm |title=German Ammunition, Guns and Mountings Definitions |accessdate=19 May 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080517110752/http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNGER_projectiles.htm| archivedate= 17 May 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nThe memoirs of Alexander Grant, Gunner on ''Lion'', suggest that some British officers were aware of the dangers of careless handling of cordite:\n\n{{quote|With the introduction of cordite to replace powder for firing guns, regulations regarding the necessary precautions for handling explosives became unconsciously considerably relaxed, even I regret to say, to a dangerous degree throughout the Service. The gradual lapse in the regulations on board ship seemed to be due to two factors. First, cordite is a much safer explosive to handle than gun-powder. Second, but more important, the altered construction of the magazines on board led to a feeling of false security....The iron or steel deck, the disappearance of the wood lining, the electric lights fitted inside, the steel doors, open because there was now no chute for passing cartridges out; all this gave officers and men a comparative easiness of mind regarding the precautions necessary with explosive material.<ref>[http://www.worldwar1.co.uk/grant.htm Memoir of Gunnery Officer Alexander Grant]</ref>}}\n\nGrant had already introduced measures onboard ''Lion'' to limit the number of cartridges kept outside the magazine and to ensure doors were kept closed, probably contributing to her survival.<ref>marder III p. 174</ref>\n\nOn 5 June 1916, the First Lord of the Admiralty advised Cabinet Members that the three battlecruisers had been lost due to unsafe cordite management.<ref name=\"Lawrence Burr p.40\">British Battlecruisers 1914–18, Lawrence Burr, Tony Bryan p. 40</ref>\n\nOn 22 November 1916, following detailed interviews of the survivors of the destroyed battlecruisers, the Third Sea Lord, Rear Admiral Tudor, issued a report detailing the stacking of charges by the gun crews in the handling rooms to speed up loading of the guns.<ref name=\"Lawrence Burr p.40\"/>\n\nAfter the battle, the B.C.F. Gunnery Committee issued a report (at the command of Admiral David Beatty) advocating immediate changes in flash protection and charge handling. It reported, among other things, that:\n* Some vent plates in magazines allowed flash into the magazines and should be retro-fitted to a new standard.\n* Bulkheads in HMS ''Lion''{{'}}s magazine showed buckling from fire under pressure (overpressure) – despite being flooded and therefore supported by water pressure – and must be made stronger.\n* Doors opening inward to magazines were an extreme danger.\n* Current designs of turrets could not eliminate flash from shell bursts in the turret from reaching the handling rooms.\n* Ignition pads must not be attached to charges but instead be placed just before ramming.\n* Better methods must be found for safe storage of ready charges than the current method.\n* Some method for rapidly drowning charges already in the handling path must be devised.\n* Handling scuttles (special flash-proof fittings for moving propellant charges through ship's bulkheads), designed to handle overpressure, must be fitted.<ref>[http://www.dreadnoughtproject.org/tfs/index.php/Advance_Report_of_B.C.F._Gunnery_Committee Advance Report of B.C.F. Gunnery Committee]</ref>\n\nThe United States Navy in 1939 had quantities of Cordite N, a Canadian propellant that was much improved, yet its [[Bureau of Ordnance]] objected strongly to its use onboard U.S. warships, considering it unsuitable as a naval propellant due to its inclusion of nitroglycerin.<ref name=\"navweaps.com\"/>\n\n====Gunnery====\nBritish gunnery control systems, based on [[Dreyer Fire Control Table|Dreyer tables]], were well in advance of the German ones, as demonstrated by the proportion of main calibre hits made on the German fleet. Because of its demonstrated advantages, it was installed on ships progressively as the war went on, had been fitted to a majority of British capital ships by May, 1916, and had been installed on the main guns of all but two of the Grand Fleet's capital ships.<ref>Brooks p. 224</ref> The Royal Navy used centralised [[fire-control system]]s on their capital ships, directed from a point high up on the ship where the fall of shells could best be seen, utilising a director sight for both training and elevating the guns. In contrast, the German battlecruisers controlled the fire of turrets using a training-only director, which also did not fire the guns at once. The rest of the German capital ships were without even this innovation. German range-finding equipment was generally superior to the British {{convert|9|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} FT24, as its operators were trained to a higher standard due to the complexity of the Zeiss {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} range finders. Their [[Stereoscopic rangefinder|stereoscopic]] design meant that in certain conditions they could range on a target enshrouded by smoke.<ref>Brooks, pp. 221–222</ref> The German equipment was not superior in range to the British [[Barr & Stroud]] {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} rangefinder found in the newest British capital ships, and, unlike the British range finders, the German range takers had to be replaced as often as every thirty minutes, as their eyesight became impaired, affecting the ranges provided to their gunnery equipment.<ref>Brooks, p. 223</ref>\n\nThe results of the battle confirmed the value of firing guns by centralised director. The battle prompted the Royal Navy to install director firing systems in cruisers and destroyers, where it had not thus far been used, and for secondary armament on battleships.<ref>Marder III pp. 213–214</ref>\n\nGerman ships were considered to have been quicker in determining the correct range to targets, thus obtaining an early advantage. The British used a 'bracket system', whereby a salvo was fired at the best-guess range and, depending where it landed, the range was progressively corrected up or down until successive shots were landing in front of and behind the enemy. The Germans used a 'ladder system', whereby an initial volley of three shots at different ranges was used, with the centre shot at the best-guess range. The ladder system allowed the gunners to get ranging information from the three shots more quickly than the bracket system, which required waiting between shots to see how the last had landed. British ships adopted the German system.<ref>Marder III pp.166, 214</ref>\n\nIt was determined that {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=on}} range finders of the sort issued to most British ships were not adequate at long range and did not perform as well as the {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} range finders on some of the most modern ships. In 1917, range finders of base lengths of {{convert|25|and|30|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} were introduced on the battleships to improve accuracy.<ref>Marder p. 215</ref>\n\n====Signalling====\nThroughout the battle, British ships experienced difficulties with communications, whereas the Germans did not suffer such problems. The British preferred signalling using ship-to-ship flag and lamp signals, avoiding wireless, whereas the Germans used wireless successfully. One conclusion drawn was that flag signals were not a satisfactory way to control the fleet. Experience using lamps, particularly at night when issuing challenges to other ships, demonstrated this was an excellent way to advertise your precise location to an enemy, inviting a reply by gunfire. Recognition signals by lamp, once seen, could also easily be copied in future engagements.<ref>Marder III pp. 175–176</ref>\n\nBritish ships both failed to report engagements with the enemy but also, in the case of cruisers and destroyers, failed to actively seek out the enemy. A culture had arisen within the fleet of not acting without orders, which could prove fatal when any circumstances prevented orders being sent or received. Commanders failed to engage the enemy because they believed other, more senior officers must also be aware of the enemy nearby, and would have given orders to act if this was expected. Wireless, the most direct way to pass messages across the fleet (although it was being jammed by German ships), was avoided either for perceived reasons of not giving away the presence of ships or for fear of cluttering up the airwaves with unnecessary reports.<ref>Marder III pp. 176–178</ref>\n\n====Fleet Standing Orders====\nNaval operations were governed by standing orders issued to all the ships. These attempted to set out what ships should do in all circumstances, particularly in situations where ships would have to react without referring to higher authority, or when communications failed. A number of changes were introduced as a result of experience gained in the battle.\n\nA new signal was introduced instructing squadron commanders to act independently as they thought best while still supporting the main fleet, particularly for use when circumstances would make it difficult to send detailed orders. The description stressed that this was not intended to be the only time commanders might take independent action, but was intended to make plain times when they definitely should. Similarly, instructions on what to do if the fleet was instructed to take evasive action against torpedoes were amended. Commanders were given discretion that if their part of the fleet was not under immediate attack, they should continue engaging the enemy rather than turning away with the rest of the fleet. In this battle, when the fleet turned away from Scheer's destroyer attack covering his retreat, not all the British ships had been affected, and could have continued to engage the enemy.<ref>MarderIII p. 222</ref>\n\nA number of opportunities to attack enemy ships by torpedo had presented themselves but had been missed. All ships, not just the destroyers armed principally with torpedoes but also battleships, were reminded that they carried torpedoes intended to be used whenever an opportunity arose. Destroyers were instructed to close the enemy fleet to fire torpedoes as soon as engagements between the main ships on either side would keep enemy guns busy directed at larger targets. Destroyers should also be ready to immediately engage enemy destroyers if they should launch an attack, endeavouring to disrupt their chances of launching torpedoes and keep them away from the main fleet.<ref>Marder III pp. 224–225</ref>\n\nTo add some flexibility when deploying for attack, a new signal was provided for deploying the fleet to the centre, rather than as previously only either to left or right of the standard closed-up formation for travelling. The fast and powerful 5th Battle Squadron was moved to the front of the cruising formation so it would have the option of deploying left or right depending upon the enemy position. In the event of engagements at night, although the fleet still preferred to avoid night fighting, a destroyer and cruiser squadron would be specifically detailed to seek out the enemy and launch destroyer attacks.<ref>Marder III p. 226</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\nAt the time, Jellicoe was criticised for his caution and for allowing Scheer to escape.<ref name=Massie-631>Massie, p. 631</ref> Beatty, in particular, was convinced that Jellicoe had missed a tremendous opportunity to annihilate the High Seas Fleet<ref>Massie, p. 670</ref> and win what would amount to another [[battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]]. Jellicoe was promoted away from active command to become First Sea Lord, the professional head of the Royal Navy, while Beatty replaced him as commander of the Grand Fleet.\n\nThe controversy raged within the navy and in public for about a decade after the war. Criticism focused on Jellicoe's decision at 19:15. Scheer had ordered his cruisers and destroyers forward in a torpedo attack to cover the turning away of his battleships. Jellicoe chose to turn to the south-east, and so keep out of range of the torpedoes. Supporters of Jellicoe, including the historian [[Cyril Falls]], pointed to the folly of risking defeat in battle when one already has [[command of the sea]].<ref name=Massie-675>{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |page=675}}</ref> Jellicoe himself, in a letter to the Admiralty seventeen months before the battle, said that he intended to turn his fleet away from any mass torpedo attack (that being the universally accepted proper tactical response to such attacks, practised by all the major navies of the world<ref name=Massie-675/>). He said that, in the event of a fleet engagement in which the enemy turned away, he would assume they intended to draw him over mines or submarines, and he would decline to be so drawn. The Admiralty approved this plan and expressed full confidence in Jellicoe at the time (October 1914).<ref>Massie, p. 632</ref>\n\nThe stakes were high, the pressure on Jellicoe immense, and his caution certainly understandable. His judgement might have been that even 90% odds in favour were not good enough to bet the British Empire. The former [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] [[Winston Churchill]] said of the battle that Jellicoe \"was the only man on either side who could have lost the war in an afternoon.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |page=681}}</ref>\n\nThe criticism of Jellicoe also fails to sufficiently credit Scheer, who was determined to preserve his fleet by avoiding the full British battle line, and who showed great skill in effecting his escape.<ref>{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |page=672}}</ref>\n\n===Beatty's actions===\nOn the other hand, some of Jellicoe's supporters condemned the actions of Beatty for the British failure to achieve a complete victory.<ref>{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=670, 679}}</ref> Although Beatty was undeniably brave, his mismanagement of the initial encounter with Hipper's squadron and the High Seas Fleet cost considerable advantage in the first hours of the battle.<ref>{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=673–674}}</ref> His most glaring failure was in not providing Jellicoe with periodic information on the position, course, and speed of the High Seas Fleet.<ref>{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |page=674}}</ref> Beatty, aboard the battlecruiser ''Lion'', left behind the four fast battleships of the 5th Battle Squadron – the most powerful warships in the world at the time – engaging with six ships when better control would have given him 10 against Hipper's five. Though Beatty's larger {{convert|13.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns out-ranged Hipper's {{convert|11|and|12|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns by thousands of yards, Beatty held his fire for 10 minutes and closed the German squadron until within range of the Germans' superior gunnery, under lighting conditions that favoured the Germans.<ref>{{cite book|title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=589–590}}</ref> Most of the British losses in tonnage occurred in Beatty's force.\n\n==Death toll==\n{{See also|Damage to major ships at the Battle of Jutland}}\n{{See also|List of ships sunk at the Battle of Jutland}}\nThe total loss of life was 9,823 men, of which the British losses were 6,784 and German losses were 3,039.<ref>Brewers Dictionary of 20th Century Phrase and Fable</ref> Counted among the British losses are 2 members of the [[Royal Australian Navy]], and 1 member of the [[Royal Canadian Navy]]. 6 Australian nationals serving in the Royal Navy were also killed.<ref name=\"Commonwealth\">[http://www.gwpda.org/naval/jutloscm.htm Great War Primary Documents Archive, 2007, \"Battle of Jutland – Commonwealth Casualties\"] (Access: 24 February 2012).</ref>\n\n===British===\n113,300 [[long ton|ton]]s sunk:<ref name=\"Nasmith, pg261\"/>\n* Battlecruisers {{HMS|Indefatigable|1909|2}}, {{HMS|Queen Mary||2}}, {{HMS|Invincible|1907|2}}\n* Armoured cruisers {{HMS|Black Prince|1904|2}}, {{HMS|Warrior|1905|2}}, {{HMS|Defence|1907|2}}\n* Flotilla leaders {{HMS|Tipperary|1915|2}}\n* Destroyers {{HMS|Shark|1912|2}}, {{HMS|Sparrowhawk|1912|2}}, {{HMS|Turbulent|1916|2}}, {{HMS|Ardent|1913|2}}, {{HMS|Fortune|1913|2}}, {{HMS|Nomad||2}}, {{HMS|Nestor|1915|2}}\n\n===German===\n62,300 [[long ton|ton]]s sunk:<ref name=\"Nasmith, pg261\"/>\n* Battlecruiser {{SMS|Lützow||2}}\n* Pre-Dreadnought {{SMS|Pommern||2}}\n* Light cruisers {{SMS|Frauenlob||2}}, {{SMS|Elbing||2}}, {{SMS|Rostock||2}}, {{SMS|Wiesbaden||2}}\n* Destroyers (Heavy torpedo-boats) {{SMS|V48||2}}, {{SMS|S35||2}}, {{SMS|V27||2}}, {{SMS|V4||2}}, {{SMS|V29||2}}\n\n==Selected honours==\nThe [[Victoria Cross]] is the highest military decoration awarded for valour \"in the face of the enemy\" to members of the [[British Empire]] armed forces.

This victory was used to repress the memory of the German navy's initiation of the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]], as well as the memory of the defeat in World War I in general. (The celebrations of the [[Battle of Tannenberg]] played a similar role.) This is especially true for the city of [[Wilhelmshaven]], where wreath-laying ceremonies and torch-lit parades were performed until the end of the 1960s.<ref>Götz: Remembering the Battle, p. 360</ref>\nIn 1916 Contreadmiral Friedrich von Kühlwetter (1865-1931) wrote a detailed analysis of the battle and published it in a book under the title \"Skagerrak\" (first anonymously published), which was reprinted in large numbers until after WWII and had a huge influence in keeping the battle in public memory amongst Germans as it was not tainted by the ideology of the Third Reich.

The battle was the climax of a [[Mediterranean campaign of 1798|naval campaign]] that had ranged across the Mediterranean during the previous three months, as a large French convoy sailed from [[Toulon]] to [[Alexandria]] carrying an expeditionary force under General [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. The British fleet was led in the battle by Rear-Admiral Sir [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]]; they decisively defeated the French under Vice-Admiral [[François-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers]].\n\nBonaparte sought to invade Egypt as the first step in a campaign against [[British India]], part of a greater effort to drive Britain out of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. As Bonaparte's fleet crossed the Mediterranean, it was pursued by a British force under Nelson who had been sent from the British fleet in the [[Tagus]] to learn the purpose of the French expedition and to defeat it. He chased the French for more than two months, on several occasions only missing them by a matter of hours. Bonaparte was aware of Nelson's pursuit and enforced absolute secrecy about his destination. He was able to capture [[Malta]] and then land in Egypt without interception by the British naval forces.\n\nWith the French army ashore, the French fleet anchored in Aboukir Bay, {{convert|20|mi|km}} northeast of Alexandria. Commander Vice-Admiral François-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers believed that he had established a formidable defensive position. The British fleet arrived off Egypt on 1 August and discovered Brueys's dispositions, and Nelson ordered an immediate attack. His ships advanced on the French line and split into two divisions as they approached. One cut across the head of the line and passed between the anchored French and the shore, while the other engaged the seaward side of the French fleet. Trapped in a crossfire, the leading French warships were battered into surrender during a fierce three-hour battle, while the centre succeeded in repelling the initial British attack. As British reinforcements arrived, the centre came under renewed assault and, at 22:00, the French flagship [[French ship Orient (1791)|''Orient'']] exploded. The rear division of the French fleet attempted to break out of the bay, with Brueys dead and his [[vanguard]] and centre defeated, but only two [[ships of the line]] and two [[frigate]]s escaped from a total of 17 ships engaged.\n\nThe battle reversed the strategic situation between the two nations' forces in the Mediterranean and entrenched the Royal Navy in the dominant position that it retained for the rest of the war. It also encouraged other European countries to turn against France, and was a factor in the outbreak of the [[War of the Second Coalition]]. Bonaparte's army was trapped in Egypt, and Royal Navy dominance off the Syrian coast contributed significantly to its defeat at the [[Siege of Acre (1799)|Siege of Acre]] in 1799 which preceded Bonaparte's return to Europe. Nelson had been wounded in the battle, but he was proclaimed a hero across Europe and was subsequently made [[Baron Nelson]]—although he was privately dissatisfied with his rewards. His captains were also highly praised and went on to form the nucleus of the legendary [[Nelson's Band of Brothers]]. The legend of the battle has remained prominent in the popular consciousness, with perhaps the best-known representation being [[Felicia Hemans]]' 1826 poem ''[[Casabianca (poem)|Casabianca]]''.\n\n==Background==\n[[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s victories in northern Italy over the [[Austrian Empire]] helped secure victory for the French in the [[War of the First Coalition]] in 1797, and Great Britain remained the only major European power still at war with the [[French First Republic|French Republic]].<ref name=\"SM224\">[[#Reference-Maffeo|Maffeo, p. 224]]</ref> The [[French Directory]] investigated a number of strategic options to counter British opposition, including projected invasions of Ireland and Britain and the expansion of the [[French Navy]] to challenge the [[Royal Navy]] at sea.<ref name=\"WJ113\">[[#Reference-James|James, p. 113]]</ref> Despite significant efforts, British control of Northern European waters rendered these ambitions impractical in the short term,<ref name=\"PP116\">[[#Reference-Padfield|Padfield, p. 116]]</ref> and the Royal Navy remained firmly in control of the Atlantic Ocean. However, the French navy was dominant in the Mediterranean, following the withdrawal of the British fleet after the outbreak of war between Britain and Spain in 1796.<ref name=\"JK36\">[[#Reference-Keegan|Keegan, p. 36]]</ref> This allowed Bonaparte to propose an [[Napoleonic Campaign in Egypt|invasion of Egypt]] as an alternative to confronting Britain directly, believing that the British would be too distracted by an imminent [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|Irish uprising]] to intervene in the Mediterranean.<ref name=\"JHR141\">[[#Reference-Rose|Rose, p. 141]]</ref>\n\nBonaparte believed that, by establishing a permanent presence in Egypt (nominally part of the neutral [[Ottoman Empire]]), the French would obtain a staging point for future operations against [[British India]], possibly in conjunction with the [[Tipu Sultan]] of [[Seringapatam]], that might successfully drive the British out of the war.<ref name=\"RLA7\">[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 7]]</ref> The campaign would sever the chain of communication that connected Britain with India, an essential part of the [[British Empire]] whose trade generated the wealth that Britain required to prosecute the war successfully.<ref name=\"SM230\">[[#Reference-Maffeo|Maffeo, p. 230]]</ref> The French Directory agreed with Bonaparte's plans, although a major factor in their decision was a desire to see the politically ambitious Bonaparte and the fiercely loyal veterans of his Italian campaigns travel as far from France as possible.<ref name=\"NR457\">[[#Reference-Rodger|Rodger, p. 457]]</ref> During the spring of 1798, Bonaparte assembled more than 35,000 soldiers in Mediterranean France and Italy and developed a powerful fleet at [[Toulon]].

Alarmed by reports of French preparations on the Mediterranean coast, [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|Lord Spencer]] at the [[Admiralty]] sent a message to Vice-Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Earl St. Vincent]], commander of the Mediterranean Fleet based in the [[Tagus River]], to despatch a squadron to investigate.<ref name=\"SM233\">[[#Reference-Maffeo|Maffeo, p. 233]]</ref> This squadron, consisting of three [[Ship of the line|ships of the line]] and three [[frigates]], was entrusted to Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson.\n\nNelson was a highly experienced officer who had been blinded in one eye during fighting in [[Corsica]] in 1794 and subsequently commended for his capture of two Spanish [[ships of the line]] at the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1797)|Battle of Cape St. Vincent]] in February 1797.

By 24 July, the British fleet was resupplied and, having determined that the French must be somewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean, Nelson sailed again in the direction of the [[Morea]].<ref name=\"SM265\">[[#Reference-Maffeo|Maffeo, p. 265]]</ref>  On 28 July, at [[Koroni|Coron]], Nelson finally obtained intelligence describing the French attack on Egypt and turned south across the Mediterranean. His scouts, [[HMS Alexander (1778)|HMS ''Alexander'']] and [[HMS Swiftsure (1787)|HMS ''Swiftsure'']], sighted the French transport fleet at Alexandria on the afternoon of 1 August.<ref name=\"WLC355\">[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 355]]</ref>\n\n===Aboukir Bay===\nWhen Alexandria harbour had proved inadequate for his fleet, Brueys had gathered his captains and discussed their options. Bonaparte had ordered the fleet to anchor in Aboukir Bay, a shallow and exposed anchorage, but had supplemented the orders with the suggestion that, if Aboukir Bay was too dangerous, Brueys could sail north to [[Corfu]], leaving only the transports and a handful of lighter warships at Alexandria.<ref name=\"JHR142\">[[#Reference-Rose|Rose, p. 142]]</ref> Brueys refused, in the belief that his squadron could provide essential support to the French army on shore, and called his captains aboard his 120-gun flagship ''[[French ship Orient (1791)|Orient]]'' to discuss their response should Nelson discover the fleet in its anchorage. Despite vocal opposition from [[Contre-amiral]] [[Armand Blanquet]],<ref name=\"EB199\">[[#Reference-Bradford|Bradford, p. 199]]</ref>  who insisted that the fleet would be best able to respond in open water, the rest of the captains agreed that anchoring in a [[line of battle]] inside the bay presented the strongest tactic for confronting Nelson.<ref name=\"WJ159\">[[#Reference-James|James, p. 159]]</ref> It is possible that Bonaparte envisaged Aboukir Bay as a temporary anchorage: on 27 July, he expressed the expectation that Brueys had already transferred his ships to Alexandria, and three days later, he issued orders for the fleet to make for Corfu in preparation for naval operations against the Ottoman territories in the Balkans,<ref name=\"JHR143\">[[#Reference-Rose|Rose, p. 143]]</ref> although [[Bedouin]] [[Irregular military|partisans]]<ref name=\"EB192\">[[#Reference-Bradford|Bradford, p. 192]]</ref> intercepted and killed the courier carrying the instructions. \n[[File:François-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers.jpg|thumb|upright|left|François-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers<br/>artist unknown, [[Palace of Versailles]]|alt=A man in an ornate naval uniform with long grey hair stands on a ship's quarterdeck.]]\nAboukir Bay is a coastal indentation {{convert|16|nmi|km}} across, stretching from the village of [[Abu Qir]] in the west to the town of [[Rosetta]] to the east, where one of the mouths of the [[River Nile]] empties into the Mediterranean.<ref name=\"SM268\">[[#Reference-Maffeo|Maffeo, p.&nbsp;268–269]]</ref> In 1798, the bay was protected at its western end by extensive rocky shoals which ran {{convert|3|mi|km}} into the bay from a [[promontory]] guarded by Aboukir Castle. A small fort situated on [[Nelson's Island|an island]] among the rocks protected the shoals.<ref name=\"WLC357\">[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 357]]</ref> The fort was garrisoned by French soldiers and armed with at least four cannon and two heavy [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]].<ref name=\"WJ160\">[[#Reference-James|James, p. 160]]</ref> Brueys had augmented the fort with his [[bomb vessel]]s and [[gunboat]]s, anchored among the rocks to the west of the island in a position to give support to the head of the French line. Further shoals ran unevenly to the south of the island and extended across the bay in a rough semicircle approximately {{convert|1650|yd|m}} from the shore.<ref name=\"WLC358\">[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 358]]</ref> These shoals were too shallow to permit the passage of larger warships, and so Brueys ordered his thirteen ships of the line to form up in a line of battle following the northeastern edge of the shoals to the south of the island, a position that allowed the ships to disembark supplies from their port sides while covering the landings with their starboard batteries.<ref name=\"RG31\">[[#Reference-Gardiner|Gardiner, p. 31]]</ref> Orders were issued for each ship to attach strong cables to the bow and stern of their neighbours, which would effectively turn the line into a long battery forming a theoretically impregnable barrier.<ref name=\"OW66\">[[#Reference-Warner|Warner, p. 66]]</ref> Brueys positioned a second, inner line of four frigates approximately {{convert|350|yd|m}} west of the main line, roughly halfway between the line and the shoal. The van of the French line was led by ''[[French ship Guerrier (1754)|Guerrier]]'', positioned {{convert|2400|yd|m}} southeast of Aboukir Island and about {{convert|1000|yd|m}} from the edge of the shoals that surrounded the island.<ref name=\"WJ160\"/> The line stretched southeast, with the centre bowed seawards away from the shoal. The French ships were spaced at intervals of {{convert|160|yd|m}} and the whole line was {{convert|2850|yd|m}} long,<ref name=\"WLC359\">[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 359]]</ref> with the flagship ''Orient'' at the centre and two large 80-gun ships anchored on either side.<ref name=\"NM260\">[[#Reference-Mostert|Mostert, p. 260]]</ref> The rear division of the line was under the command of Contre-amiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] in ''[[French ship Guillaume Tell (1795)|Guillaume Tell]]''.<ref name=\"WJ160\"/>\n\nIn deploying his ships in this way, Brueys hoped that the British would be forced by the shoals to attack his strong centre and rear, allowing his van to use the prevailing northeasterly wind to counterattack the British once they were engaged.<ref name=\"PP120\">[[#Reference-Padfield|Padfield, p. 120]]</ref> However, he had made a serious misjudgement: he had left enough room between ''Guerrier'' and the shoals for an enemy ship to cut across the head of the French line and proceed between the shoals and the French ships, allowing the unsupported vanguard to be caught in a crossfire by two divisions of enemy ships.<ref name=\"RLA24\"/>  Compounding this error, the French only prepared their ships for battle on their starboard (seaward) sides, from which they expected the attack would have to come; their landward port sides were unprepared.<ref>George A. Henty, ''At Aboukir and Acre: A Story of Napoleon's Invasion of Egypt'', Fireship Press, 2008, p. 295.</ref>\nThe port side gun ports were closed, and the decks on that side were uncleared, with various stored items blocking access to the guns.<ref>R.G. Grant, ''Battle at Sea: 3,000 Years of Naval Warfare'', DK Publications, 2011, p. 180.</ref>  Brueys' dispositions had a second significant flaw: The 160-yard gaps between ships were large enough for a British ship to push through and break the French line.<ref name=\"RG13\">[[#Reference-Gardiner|Gardiner, p. 13]]</ref> Furthermore, not all of the French captains had followed Brueys' orders to attach cables to their neighbours' bow and stern, which would have prevented such a manoeuvre.<ref name=\"JK63\">[[#Reference-Keegan|Keegan, p. 63]]</ref> The problem was exacerbated by orders to only anchor at the bow, which allowed the ships to swing with the wind and widened the gaps. It also created areas within the French line not covered by the broadside of any ship. British vessels could anchor in those spaces and engage the French without reply. In addition, the deployment of Brueys' fleet prevented the rear from effectively supporting the van due to the prevailing winds.<ref name=\"WLC372\">[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 372]]</ref>\n\nA more pressing problem for Brueys was a lack of food and water for the fleet: Bonaparte had unloaded almost all of the provisions carried aboard and no supplies were reaching the ships from the shore. To remedy this, Brueys sent foraging parties of 25 men from each ship along the coast to requisition food, dig wells, and collect water.<ref name=\"OW66\"/> Constant attacks by Bedouin partisans, however, required escorts of heavily armed guards for each party. Hence, up to a third of the fleet's sailors were away from their ships at any one time.<ref name=\"NM261\">[[#Reference-Mostert|Mostert, p. 261]]</ref> Brueys wrote a letter describing the situation to [[List of Naval Ministers of France|Minister of Marine]] [[Étienne Eustache Bruix]], reporting that \"Our crews are weak, both in number and quality. Our rigging, in general, out of repair, and I am sure it requires no little courage to undertake the management of a fleet furnished with such tools.\"<ref name=\"RLA22\">[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 22]]</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n{{details|Order of battle at the Battle of the Nile}}\n===Nelson's arrival===\n[[File:Battle of the Nile, Whitcombe2.jpg|thumb|''Battle of the Nile, Augt 1st 1798'', [[Thomas Whitcombe]], 1816, [[National Maritime Museum]].

The ships are firing on eight ships flying the British flag that are steadily approaching them from the right of the picture.]]\nAlthough initially disappointed that the main French fleet was not at Alexandria, Nelson knew from the presence of the transports that they must be nearby. At 14:00 on 1 August, lookouts on [[HMS Zealous (1785)|HMS ''Zealous'']] reported the French anchored in Aboukir Bay, its signal lieutenant just beating the lieutenant on [[HMS Goliath (1781)|HMS ''Goliath'']] with the signal, but inaccurately describing 16 French ships of the line instead of 13.<ref name=\"PP118\">[[#Reference-Padfield|Padfield, p. 118]]</ref> At the same time, French lookouts on ''[[French ship Heureux (1782)|Heureux]]'', the ninth ship in the French line, sighted the British fleet approximately  nine nautical miles off the mouth of Aboukir Bay. The French initially reported just 11 British ships – ''Swiftsure'' and ''Alexander'' were still returning from their scouting operations at Alexandria, and so were {{convert|3|nmi|km}} to the west of the main fleet, out of sight.<ref name=\"RLA23\">[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 23]]</ref>  Troubridge's ship, [[HMS Culloden (1783)|HMS ''Culloden'']]'','' was also some distance from the main body, towing a captured merchant ship. At the sight of the French, Troubridge abandoned the vessel and made strenuous efforts to rejoin Nelson.<ref name=\"PP118\"/> Due to the need for so many sailors to work onshore, Brueys had not deployed any of his lighter warships as scouts, which left him unable to react swiftly to the sudden appearance of the British.<ref name=\"NR460\">[[#Reference-Rodger|Rodger, p. 460]]</ref>\n\nAs his ships readied for action, Brueys ordered his captains to gather for a conference on ''Orient'' and hastily recalled his shore parties, although most had still not returned by the start of the battle.<ref name=\"RLA23\" /> To replace them, large numbers of men were taken out of the frigates and distributed among the ships of the line.<ref name=\"WJ161\" /> Brueys also hoped to lure the British fleet onto the shoals at Aboukir Island, sending the brigs ''[[French brig Alerte (1787)|Alerte]]'' and ''Railleur'' to act as decoys in the shallow waters.<ref name=\"WLC359\" /> By 16:00, ''Alexander'' and ''Swiftsure'' were also in sight, although some distance from the main British fleet. Brueys gave orders to abandon the plan to remain at anchor and instead for his line to set sail.<ref name=\"NM265\">[[#Reference-Mostert|Mostert, p. 265]]</ref> Blanquet protested the order on the grounds that there were not enough men aboard the French ships to both sail the ships and man the guns.<ref name=\"OW72\">[[#Reference-Warner|Warner, p. 72]]</ref> Nelson gave orders for his leading ships to slow down, to allow the British fleet to approach in a more organised formation. This convinced Brueys that rather than risk an evening battle in confined waters, the British were planning to wait for the following day. He rescinded his earlier order to sail.<ref name=\"EB200\">[[#Reference-Bradford|Bradford, p. 200]]</ref>  Brueys may have been hoping that the delay would allow him to slip past the British during the night and thus follow Bonaparte's orders not to engage the British fleet directly if he could avoid it.<ref name=\"WJ161\">[[#Reference-James|James, p. 161]]</ref>\n\nNelson ordered the fleet to slow down at 16:00 to allow his ships to rig \"springs\" on their anchor cables, a system of attaching the bow anchor that increased stability and allowed his ships to swing their [[broadside]]s to face an enemy while stationary. It also increased manoeuvrability and therefore reduced the risk of coming under [[raking fire]].<ref name=\"WLC360\">[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 360]]</ref> Nelson's plan, shaped through discussion with his senior captains during the return voyage to Alexandria,<ref name=\"SM268\" /> was to advance on the French and pass down the seaward side of the van and centre of the French line, so that each French ship would face two British ships and the massive ''Orient'' would be fighting against three.<ref name=\"WJ162\">[[#Reference-James|James, p. 162]]</ref> The direction of the wind meant that the French rear division would be unable to join the battle easily and would be cut off from the front portions of the line.<ref name=\"WJ165\" /> To ensure that in the smoke and confusion of a night battle his ships would not accidentally open fire on one another, Nelson ordered that each ship prepare four horizontal lights at the head of their [[mizzen]] mast and  hoist an illuminated [[White Ensign]], which was different enough from the [[French tricolour]] that it would not be mistaken in poor visibility, reducing the risk that British ships might fire on one another in the darkness.<ref name=\"WJ166\">[[#Reference-James|James, p. 166]]</ref> As his ship was readied for battle, Nelson held a final dinner with ''Vanguard''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s officers, announcing as he rose: \"Before this time tomorrow I shall have gained a [[peerage of the United Kingdom|peerage]] or [[Westminster Abbey]],\"<ref name=\"PP119\">[[#Reference-Padfield|Padfield, p. 119]]</ref> in reference to the rewards of victory or the traditional burial place of British military heroes.\n\n[[File:Pocock's Battle of the Nile.jpg|thumb|left|''The Battle of the Nile, 1 August 1798'', [[Nicholas Pocock]], 1808, [[National Maritime Museum]]|alt=A broad view of a bay.

Brueys, now expecting to come under attack that night, ordered each of his ships to place springs on their anchor cables and prepare for action.<ref name=\"RLA23\"/> He sent the ''Alerte'' ahead, which passed close to the leading British ships and then steered sharply to the west over the shoal, in the hope that the ships of the line might follow and become grounded.<ref name=\"EB200\"/> None of Nelson's captains fell for the ruse and the British fleet continued undeterred.<ref name=\"WJ162\"/> At 17:30, Nelson hailed one of his two leading ships, HMS ''Zealous'' under Captain [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Samuel Hood]], which had been racing ''Goliath'' to be the first to fire on the French. The admiral ordered Hood to establish the safest course into the harbour. The British had no charts of the depth or shape of the bay, except a rough sketch map ''Swiftsure'' had obtained from a merchant captain, an inaccurate British atlas on ''Zealous'',<ref name=\"SM269\">[[#Reference-Maffeo|Maffeo, p. 269]]</ref> and a 35-year-old French map aboard ''Goliath''.<ref name=\"RLA24\">[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 24]]</ref> Hood replied that he would take careful [[Depth sounding|soundings]] as he advanced to test the depth of the water,<ref name=\"WLC361\">[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 361]]</ref> and that, \"If you will allow the honour of leading you into battle, I will keep the lead going.\"<ref name=\"EB202\">[[#Reference-Bradford|Bradford, p. 202]]</ref> Shortly afterwards, Nelson paused to speak with the brig [[HMS Mutine (1797)|HMS ''Mutine'']], whose commander, Lieutenant [[Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet|Thomas Hardy]], had seized some [[maritime pilots]] from a small Alexandrine vessel.<ref name=\"PP123\">[[#Reference-Padfield|Padfield, p. 123]]</ref> As ''Vanguard'' came to a stop, the following ships slowed. This caused a gap to open up between ''Zealous'' and ''Goliath'' and the rest of the fleet.<ref name=\"RLA24\"/> To counter this effect, Nelson ordered [[HMS Theseus (1786)|HMS ''Theseus'']] under Captain [[Ralph Willett Miller|Ralph Miller]] to pass his flagship and join ''Zealous'' and ''Goliath'' in the vanguard.<ref name=\"WLC361\"/> By 18:00, the British fleet was again under full sail, ''Vanguard'' sixth in the line of ten ships as ''Culloden'' trailed behind to the north and  ''Alexander'' and ''Swiftsure'' hastened to catch up to the west.<ref name=\"WJ163\">[[#Reference-James|James, p. 163]]</ref> Following the rapid change from a loose formation to a rigid line of battle both fleets raised their colours; each British ship added additional [[Union Flag]]s in its rigging in case its main flag was shot away.<ref name=\"WJ164\">[[#Reference-James|James, p. 164]]</ref> At 18:20, as ''Goliath'' and ''Zealous'' rapidly bore down on them, the leading French ships ''Guerrier'' and ''[[French ship Conquérant (1747)|Conquérant]]'' opened fire.<ref name=\"RG33\">[[#Reference-Gardiner|Gardiner, p. 33]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Map Battle of the Nile 1798-en.png|thumb|350px|Map of ship positions and movements during the Battle of Aboukir Bay, 1–2 August 1798.

On his own initiative, Foley decided to exploit this tactical error and changed his angle of approach to sail through the gap.<ref name=\"EB202\"/> As the bow of ''Guerrier'' came within range, ''Goliath'' opened fire, inflicting severe damage with a double-shotted raking broadside as the British ship turned to port and passed down the unprepared port side of ''Guerrier.''<ref name=\"JK63\"/> Foley's [[Royal Marines]] and a company of Austrian grenadiers joined the attack, firing their muskets.<ref name=\"OW102\">[[#Reference-Warner|Warner, p. 102]]</ref> Foley had intended to anchor alongside the French ship and engage it closely, but his anchor took too long to descend and his ship passed ''Guerrier'' entirely.<ref name=\"NM266\">[[#Reference-Mostert|Mostert, p. 266]]</ref> ''Goliath'' eventually stopped close to the bow of ''Conquérant'', opening fire on the new opponent and using the unengaged starboard guns to exchange occasional shots with the frigate ''[[French frigate Sérieuse (1779)|Sérieuse]]'' and bomb vessel ''Hercule,'' which were anchored inshore of the battle line.<ref name=\"WLC361\"/>\n\nFoley's attack was followed by Hood in ''Zealous'', who also crossed the French line and successfully anchored next to ''Guerrier'' in the space Foley had intended, engaging the lead ship's bow from close range.<ref name=\"RLA25\">[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 25]]</ref> Within five minutes ''Guerrier''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s foremast had fallen, to cheers from the crews of the approaching British ships.<ref name=\"WLC362\">[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 362]]</ref> The speed of the British advance took the French captains by surprise; they were still aboard ''Orient'' in conference with the admiral when the firing started. Hastily launching their boats, they returned to their vessels. Captain [[Jean-François-Timothée Trullet]] of ''Guerrier'' shouted orders from his barge for his men to return fire on ''Zealous''.<ref name=\"RLA25\" />\n\nThe third British ship into action was [[HMS Orion (1787)|HMS ''Orion'']] under Captain [[James Saumarez, 1st Baron de Saumarez|Sir James Saumarez]], which rounded the engagement at the head of the battle line and passed between the French main line and the frigates that lay closer inshore.<ref name=\"PP124\">[[#Reference-Padfield|Padfield, p. 124]]</ref> As he did so, the frigate ''Sérieuse'' opened fire on ''Orion'', wounding two men. The convention in naval warfare of the time was that ships of the line did not attack frigates when there were ships of equal size to engage, but in firing first French Captain [[Claude-Jean Martin]] had negated the rule. Saumarez waited until the frigate was at close range before replying.<ref name=\"RLA26\">[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 26]]</ref> ''Orion'' needed just one broadside to reduce the frigate to a wreck, and Martin's disabled ship drifted away over the shoal.<ref name=\"WJ165\" /> During the delay this detour caused, two other British ships joined the battle: [[ HMS Theseus (1786)|Theseus]], which had been disguised as a [[first-rate]] ship,<ref name=\"OW109\">[[#Reference-Warner|Warner, p. 109]]</ref> followed Foley's track across ''Guerrier''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s bow. Miller steered his ship through the middle of the melee between the anchored British and French ships until he encountered the third French ship, ''[[HMS Spartiate (1798)|Spartiate]]''. Anchoring to port, Miller's ship opened fire at close range. [[HMS Audacious (1785)|HMS ''Audacious'']] under Captain [[Davidge Gould]] crossed the French line between ''Guerrier'' and ''Conquérant'', anchoring between the ships and raking them both.<ref name=\"WLC362\" />{{Cref2|Note B}} ''Orion'' then rejoined the action further south than intended, firing on the fifth French ship, ''[[French ship Souverain (1792)|Peuple Souverain]],'' and Admiral Blanquet's flagship, ''[[French ship Franklin (1797)|Franklin]]''.<ref name=\"WJ165\">[[#Reference-James|James, p. 165]]</ref>\n\nThe next three British ships, ''Vanguard'' in the lead followed by [[HMS Minotaur (1793)|HMS ''Minotaur'']] and [[HMS Defence (1763)|HMS ''Defence'']], remained in line of battle formation and anchored on the starboard side of the French line at 18:40.<ref name=\"RG33\" /> Nelson focused his flagship's fire on ''Spartiate'', while Captain [[Thomas Louis]] in ''Minotaur'' attacked the unengaged ''[[French ship Aquilon (1789)|Aquilon]]'' and Captain [[John Peyton (Royal Navy officer)|John Peyton]] in ''Defence'' joined the attack on ''Peuple Souverain''.<ref name=\"WLC362\" /> With the French vanguard now heavily outnumbered, the following British ships, [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|HMS ''Bellerophon'']] and [[HMS Majestic (1785)|HMS ''Majestic'']]'','' passed by the melee and advanced on the so far unengaged French centre.<ref name=\"PP127\">[[#Reference-Padfield|Padfield, p. 127]]</ref> Both ships were soon fighting enemies much more powerful than they and began to take severe damage. Captain [[Henry D'Esterre Darby|Henry Darby]] on ''Bellerophon'' missed his intended anchor near ''Franklin'' and instead found his ship underneath the main battery of the French flagship.<ref name=\"RLA28\">[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 28]]</ref> Captain [[George Blagdon Westcott]] on ''Majestic'' also missed his station and almost collided with ''Heureux'', coming under heavy fire from ''[[HMS Tonnant (1792)|Tonnant]]''.

By this time, ''Guerrier'' had been completely dismasted and heavily battered. ''Zealous'' by contrast was barely touched: Hood had situated ''Zealous'' outside the arc of most of the French ship's broadsides, and in any case ''Guerrier'' was not prepared for an engagement on both sides simultaneously, with its port guns blocked by stores.<ref name=\"WJ166\"/> Although their ship was a wreck, the crew of ''Guerrier'' refused to surrender, continuing to fire the few functional guns whenever possible despite heavy answering fire from ''Zealous''.<ref name=\"NM267\">[[#Reference-Mostert|Mostert, p. 267]]</ref> In addition to his cannon fire, Hood called up his marines and ordered them to fire volleys of musket shot at the deck of the French ship, driving the crew out of sight but still failing to secure the surrender from Captain Trullet. It was not until 21:00, when Hood sent a small boat to ''Guerrier'' with a boarding party, that the French ship finally surrendered.<ref name=\"WJ166\"/> ''Conquérant'' was defeated more rapidly, after heavy broadsides from passing British ships and the close attentions of ''Audacious'' and ''Goliath'' brought down all three masts before 19:00. With his ship immobile and badly damaged, the mortally wounded Captain [[Etienne Dalbarade]] [[Striking the colours|struck his colours]] and a boarding party seized control.<ref name=\"WLC364\"/> Unlike ''Zealous'', these British ships suffered relatively severe damage in the engagement. ''Goliath'' lost most of its rigging, suffered damage to all three masts and suffered more than 60 casualties.<ref name=\"WJ167\">[[#Reference-James|James, p. 167]]</ref> With his opponents defeated, Captain Gould on ''Audacious'' used the spring on his cable to transfer fire to ''Spartiate'', the next French ship in line. To the west of the battle the battered ''Sérieuse'' sank over the shoal. Its masts protruded from the water as survivors scrambled into boats and rowed for the shore.<ref name=\"WJ165\"/>\n[[File:Thomas Luny, Battle of the Nile2.jpg|thumb|left|''The Battle of the Nile'', [[Thomas Luny]], 1830, [[National Maritime Museum]]|alt=Four ships flying the British flag advance in the foreground towards an anchored battle line in which the only clear detail is a huge burning ship.]]\nThe transfer of ''Audacious''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s broadside to ''Spartiate'' meant that Captain [[Maurice-Julien Emeriau]] now faced three opponents. Within minutes all three of his ship's masts had fallen, but the battle around ''Spartiate'' continued until 21:00, when the badly wounded Emeriau ordered his colours struck.<ref name=\"WJ167\"/> Although ''Spartiate'' was outnumbered, it had been supported by the next in line, ''Aquilon'', which was the only ship of the French van squadron fighting a single opponent, ''Minotaur''. Captain [[Antoine René Thévenard]] used the spring on his anchor cable to angle his broadside into a raking position across the bow of Nelson's flagship, which consequently suffered more than 100 casualties, including the admiral.<ref name=\"WJ167\"/> At approximately 20:30, an iron splinter fired in a [[Naval artillery in the Age of Sail#Shot|langrage]] shot from ''Spartiate ''struck Nelson over his blinded right eye.<ref name=\"OW92\">[[#Reference-Warner|Warner, p. 92]]</ref> The wound caused a flap of skin to fall across his face, rendering him temporarily completely blind.<ref name=\"WJ175\">[[#Reference-James|James, p. 175]]</ref> Nelson collapsed into the arms of Captain [[Edward Berry]] and was carried below.

''Peuple Souverain'' drifted south towards the flagship ''Orient'', which mistakenly opened fire on the darkened vessel.<ref name=\"IG59\">[[#Reference-Germani|Germani, p. 59]]</ref> ''Orion'' and ''Defence'' were unable to immediately pursue. ''Defence'' had lost its fore topmast and an improvised [[fireship]] that drifted through the battle narrowly missed ''Orion''. The origin of this vessel, an abandoned and burning ship's boat laden with highly flammable material, is uncertain, but it may have been launched from ''Guerrier'' as the battle began.<ref name=\"WJ168\"/> ''Peuple Souverain'' anchored not far from ''Orient'', but took no further part in the fighting. The wrecked ship surrendered during the night. ''Franklin'' remained in combat, but Blanquet had suffered a severe head wound and Captain Gillet had been carried below unconscious with severe wounds. Shortly afterwards, a fire broke out on the quarterdeck after an arms locker exploded, which was eventually extinguished with difficulty by the crew.<ref name=\"OW94\">[[#Reference-Warner|Warner, p. 94]]</ref>\n\nTo the south, HMS ''Bellerophon'' was in serious trouble as the huge broadside of ''Orient'' pounded the ship.

Captain Darby recognised that his position was untenable and ordered the anchor cables cut at 20:20. The battered ship drifted away from the battle under continued fire from ''Tonnant'' as the foremast collapsed as well.<ref name=\"RG34\">[[#Reference-Gardiner|Gardiner, p. 34]]</ref> ''Orient'' had also suffered significant damage and Admiral Brueys had been struck in the midriff by a cannonball that almost cut him in half.<ref name=\"WLC366\" /> He died fifteen minutes later, remaining on deck and refusing to be carried below.<ref name=\"IG58\">[[#Reference-Germani|Germani, p. 58]]</ref> ''Orient''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s captain, [[Luc-Julien-Joseph Casabianca]], was also wounded, struck in the face by flying debris and knocked unconscious,<ref name=\"PP129\">[[#Reference-Padfield|Padfield, p. 129]]</ref> while his twelve-year-old son had a leg torn off by a cannonball as he stood beside his father.<ref name=\"OW88\">[[#Reference-Warner|Warner, p. 88]]</ref> The most southerly British ship, ''Majestic'', had become briefly entangled with the 80-gun ''Tonnant'',<ref name=\"PP128\">[[#Reference-Padfield|Padfield, p. 128]]</ref> and in the resulting battle, suffered heavy casualties. Captain [[George Blagdon Westcott]] was among the dead, killed by French musket fire.<ref name=\"NM268\">[[#Reference-Mostert|Mostert, p. 268]]</ref> Lieutenant Robert Cuthbert assumed command and successfully disentangled his ship, allowing the badly damaged ''Majestic'' to drift further southwards so that by 20:30 it was stationed between ''Tonnant'' and the next in line, ''Heureux'', engaging both.<ref name=\"WJ169\">[[#Reference-James|James, p. 169]]</ref> To support the centre, Captain Thompson of ''Leander'' abandoned the futile efforts to drag the stranded ''Culloden'' off the shoal and sailed down the embattled French line, entering the gap created by the drifting ''Peuple Souverain'' and opening a fierce raking fire on ''Franklin'' and ''Orient''.<ref name=\"WLC364\">[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 364]]</ref>\n\nWhile the battle raged in the bay, the two straggling British ships made strenuous efforts to join the engagement, focusing on the flashes of gunfire in the darkness. Warned away from the Aboukir shoals by the grounded ''Culloden'', Captain [[Benjamin Hallowell Carew|Benjamin Hallowell]] in ''Swiftsure'' passed the melee at the head of the line and aimed his ship at the French centre.<ref name=\"WLC363\" /> Shortly after 20:00, a dismasted hulk was spotted drifting in front of ''Swiftsure'' and Hallowell initially ordered his men to fire before rescinding the order, concerned for the identity of the strange vessel. Hailing the battered ship, Hallowell received the reply \"Bellerophon, going out of action disabled.\"<ref name=\"WJ169\" /> Relieved that he had not accidentally attacked one of his own ships in the darkness, Hallowell pulled up between ''Orient'' and ''Franklin'' and opened fire on them both.<ref name=\"RLA29\">[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 29]]</ref> ''Alexander'', the final unengaged British ship, which had followed ''Swiftsure'', pulled up close to ''Tonnant'', which had begun to drift away from the embattled French flagship.

Burning [[wadding]] from one of the British ships is believed to have floated onto the poop deck and ignited the paint. The fire rapidly spread through the admiral's cabin and into a ready magazine that stored [[Carcass (projectile)|carcass]] ammunition, which was designed to burn more fiercely in water than in air.<ref name=\"WJ176\"/> Alternatively, Fleet Captain [[Honoré Ganteaume]] later reported the cause as an explosion on the quarterdeck, preceded by a series of minor fires on the main deck among the ship's boats.<ref name=\"RLA34\">[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 34]]</ref> Whatever its origin, the fire spread rapidly through the ship's rigging, unchecked by the fire pumps aboard, which had been smashed by British shot.<ref name=\"RLA35\">[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 35]]</ref> A second blaze then began at the bow, trapping hundreds of sailors in the ship's waist.<ref name=\"NM270\">[[#Reference-Mostert|Mostert, p. 270]]</ref> Subsequent archaeological investigation found debris scattered over {{convert|500|m|yd}} of seabed and evidence that the ship was wracked by two huge explosions one after the other.<ref name=\"FGSinterview\"/> Hundreds of men dove into the sea to escape the flames, but fewer than 100 survived the blast.

The French ships suffered severe damage: Two ships of the line and two frigates were destroyed (as well as a bomb vessel scuttled by its crew),<ref name=\"OW121\">[[#Reference-Warner|Warner, p. 121]]</ref> and three other captured ships were too battered ever to sail again. Of the remaining prizes, only three were ever sufficiently repaired for frontline service. For weeks after the battle, bodies washed up along the Egyptian coast, decaying slowly in the intense, dry heat.<ref name=\"JC110\" />\n\nNelson, who on surveying the bay on the morning of 2 August said, \"Victory is not a name strong enough for such a scene\",<ref name=\"OW95\">[[#Reference-Warner|Warner, p. 95]]</ref> remained at anchor in Aboukir Bay for the next two weeks, preoccupied with recovering from his wound, writing dispatches, and assessing the military situation in Egypt using documents captured on board one of the prizes.<ref name=\"SM273\">[[#Reference-Maffeo|Maffeo, p. 273]]</ref> Nelson's head wound was recorded as being \"three inches long\" with \"the cranium exposed for one inch\".

The landing party removed four of the guns and destroyed the rest along with the fort they were mounted in, renaming the island \"Nelson's Island\".<ref name=\"WJ183\" />\n\nOn 10 August, Nelson sent Lieutenant Thomas Duval from ''Zealous'' with messages to the government in India. Duval travelled across the Middle East overland via camel train to [[Aleppo]] and took the [[East India Company]] ship ''Fly'' from [[Basra]] to [[Bombay]], acquainting [[Governor-General of India]] [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|Viscount Wellesley]] with the situation in Egypt.<ref name=\"RW115\">[[#Reference-Woodman|Woodman, p. 115]]</ref> On 12 August the frigates [[HMS Emerald (1796)|HMS ''Emerald'']] under Captain Thomas Moutray Waller and [[HMS Alcmene (1794)|HMS ''Alcmene'']] under Captain [[George Johnstone Hope]], and the sloop [[HMS Bonne Citoyenne (1796)|HMS ''Bonne Citoyenne'']] under Captain Robert Retalick, arrived off Alexandria.<ref name=\"WLC373\" /> Initially the British mistook the frigate squadron for French warships and ''Swiftsure ''chased them away. They returned the following day once the error had been realised.<ref name=\"WJ183\" /> The same day as the frigates arrived, Nelson sent ''Mutine'' to Britain with dispatches, under the command of Lieutenant [[Thomas Bladen Capel]], who had replaced Hardy after the latter's promotion to captain of ''Vanguard''. On 14 August, Nelson sent ''Orion'', ''Majestic'', ''Bellerophon'', ''Minotaur'', ''Defence'', ''Audacious'', ''Theseus'', ''Franklin'', ''Tonnant'', ''Aquilon'', ''Conquérant'', ''Peuple Souverain,'' and ''Spartiate'' to sea under the command of Saumarez. Many ships had only [[jury masts]] and it took a full day for the convoy to reach the mouth of the bay, finally sailing into open water on 15 August. On 16 August the British burned and destroyed the grounded prize ''Heureux'' as no longer fit for service and on 18 August also burned ''Guerrier'' and ''Mercure''.<ref name=\"WJ183\" /> On 19 August, Nelson sailed for Naples with ''Vanguard'', ''Culloden,'' and ''Alexander'', leaving Hood in command of ''Zealous'', ''Goliath'', ''Swiftsure,'' and the recently joined frigates to watch over French activities at Alexandria.<ref name=\"WJ184\">[[#Reference-James|James, p. 184]]</ref>\n\nThe first message to reach Bonaparte regarding the disaster that had overtaken his fleet arrived on 14 August at his camp on the road between [[Salahieh]] and [[Cairo]].<ref name=\"JC110\" /> The messenger was a staff officer sent by the Governor of Alexandria General [[Jean Baptiste Kléber]], and the report had been hastily written by Admiral Ganteaume, who had subsequently rejoined Villeneuve's ships at sea. One account reports that when he was handed the message, Bonaparte read it without emotion before calling the messenger to him and demanding further details. When the messenger had finished, the French general reportedly announced ''\"Nous n'avons plus de flotte: eh bien. Il faut rester en ces contrées, ou en sortir grands comme les anciens\"'' (\"We no longer have a fleet: well, we must either remain in this country or quit it as great as the ancients\").<ref name=\"WJ184\" /> Another story, as told by the general's secretary, [[Louis Antoine Fauvelet de Bourrienne|Bourienne]], claims that Bonaparte was almost overcome by the news and exclaimed \"Unfortunate Brueys, what have you done!\"<ref name=\"RLA38\" /> Bonaparte later placed much of the blame for the defeat on the wounded Admiral Blanquet, falsely accusing him of surrendering ''Franklin'' while his ship was undamaged. Protestations from Ganteaume and Minister Étienne Eustache Bruix later reduced the degree of criticism Blanquet faced, but he never again served in a command capacity.<ref name=\"WJ184\" /> Bonaparte's most immediate concern however was with his own officers, who began to question the wisdom of the entire expedition. Inviting his most senior officers to dinner, Bonaparte asked them how they were. When they replied that they were \"marvellous,\" Bonaparte responded that it was just as well, since he would have them shot if they continued \"fostering mutinies and preaching revolt.\"<ref name=\"JC111\">[[#Reference-Cole|Cole, p. 111]]</ref> To quell any uprising among the native inhabitants, Egyptians overheard discussing the battle were threatened with having their tongues cut out.<ref name=\"JC112\">[[#Reference-Cole|Cole, p. 112]]</ref>\n\n===Reaction===\nNelson's first set of dispatches were captured when ''Leander'' was intercepted and defeated by ''Généreux'' in a fierce engagement off the western shore of Crete [[Action of 18 August 1798|on 18 August 1798]].<ref name=\"NR460\"/> As a result, reports of the battle did not reach Britain until Capel arrived in ''Mutine'' on 2 October,<ref name=\"WLC373\">[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 373]]</ref> entering the Admiralty at 11:15 and personally delivering the news to Lord Spencer,<ref name=\"OW147\">[[#Reference-Warner|Warner, p. 147]]</ref> who collapsed unconscious when he heard the report.<ref name=\"EB212\"/> Although Nelson had previously been castigated in the press for failing to intercept the French fleet, rumours of the battle had begun to arrive in Britain from the continent in late September and the news Capel brought was greeted with celebrations right across the country.<ref name=\"SM277\">[[#Reference-Maffeo|Maffeo, p. 277]]</ref> Within four days Nelson had been elevated to Baron Nelson of the Nile and Burnham Thorpe, a title with which he was privately dissatisfied, believing his actions deserved better reward.<ref name=\"J&R219\">[[#Reference-Jordan|Jordan, p. 219]]</ref> [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] addressed the [[Parliament of Great Britain|Houses of Parliament]] on 20 November with the words:\n\n{{quote|The unexampled series of our naval triumphs has received fresh splendour from the memorable and decisive action, in which a detachment of my fleet, under the command of Rear-Admiral Lord Nelson, attacked, and almost totally destroyed a superior force of the enemy, strengthened by every advantage of situation.

The [[List of French monarchs|French king]] of the time, [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]], did not command the French army himself, as he suffered from severe psychotic illnesses with moderate mental incapacitation. Instead, the French were commanded by [[Constable of France|Constable]] [[Charles I of Albret|Charles d'Albret]] and various prominent French noblemen of the [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnac party]].\n\nThis battle is notable for the use of the [[English longbow]] in very large numbers, with the English and Welsh archers forming up to 80 percent of Henry's army. The battle is the centrepiece of the play ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]].\n\n==Contemporary accounts==\nThe Battle of Agincourt is well documented by at least seven contemporary accounts, three of them eyewitnesses. The approximate location of the battle has never been in dispute and the place remains relatively unaltered even after 600 years. Immediately after the battle, Henry summoned the [[herald]]s of the two armies who had watched the battle together, and with the principal French herald, Montjoie, settled on the name of the battle as Azincourt, after the nearest fortified place.{{sfn|Keegan|1976|p=86}} Two of the most frequently cited accounts come from Burgundian sources: one from [[Jean Le Fèvre de Saint-Remy]], who was present at the battle, and the other from [[Enguerrand de Monstrelet]]. The English eyewitness account comes from the anonymous ''Gesta Henrici Quinti'', believed to have been written by a chaplain in the King's household, who would have been in the baggage train at the battle.{{sfn|Curry|2000|pp=22–6}} A recent reappraisal of Henry's strategy of the Agincourt campaign incorporates these three accounts, and argues that war was seen as a legal due process for solving the disagreement over claims to the French throne.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Honig|first1=Jan Willem|title=Reappraising Late Medieval Strategy: The Example of the 1415 Agincourt Campaign|journal=War in History|date=2012|volume=19|issue=123|pages=123–151|url=http://wih.sagepub.com/content/19/2/123.abstract|accessdate=8 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Campaign==\n{{Main article|Hundred Years War}}\n\n[[Henry V of England|Henry V]] invaded France following the failure of negotiations with the French. He claimed the title of King of France through his great-grandfather [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], although in practice the English kings were generally prepared to renounce this claim if the French would acknowledge the English claim on [[Aquitaine]] and other French lands (the terms of the [[Treaty of Brétigny]]).{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=13}} He initially called a [[Magnum Concilium|Great Council]] in the spring of 1414 to discuss going to war with France, but the lords insisted that he should negotiate further and moderate his claims. In the following negotiations Henry said that he would give up his claim to the French throne if the French would pay the 1.6 million crowns outstanding from the ransom of [[John II of France|John II]] (who had been captured at the [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Battle of Poitiers]] in 1356), and concede English ownership of the lands of [[Normandy]], [[Touraine]], [[Anjou]], [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]] and [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], as well as [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]]. Henry would marry [[Catherine of Valois|Catherine]], the young daughter of [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]], and receive a dowry of 2 million crowns. The French responded with what they considered the generous terms of marriage with Catherine, a dowry of 600,000 crowns, and an enlarged Aquitaine. By 1415, negotiations had ground to a halt, with the English claiming that the French had mocked their claims and ridiculed Henry himself.{{sfn|Barker|2005|pp=67–69}} In December 1414, the English [[Parliament of England|parliament]] was persuaded to grant Henry a \"double subsidy\", a tax at twice the traditional rate, to recover his inheritance from the French. On 19 April 1415, Henry again asked the Great Council to sanction war with France, and this time they agreed.{{sfn|Barker|2005|pp=107, 114}}\n\nHenry's army landed in northern France on 13 August 1415, carried by a fleet described by Shakespeare as \"a city on the inconstant billows dancing / For so appears this fleet majestical\", often reported to comprise 1,500 ships, but probably far smaller, and besieged the port of [[Harfleur]] with an army of about 12,000, and up to 20,000 horses.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/27/henry-v-agincourt-fleet-invasion-france Guardian newspaper:French correction: Henry V's Agincourt fleet was half as big, historian claims, 28 July 2015]</ref> The [[siege of Harfleur|siege]] took longer than expected. The town surrendered on 22 September, and the English army did not leave until 8 October. The campaign season was coming to an end, and the English army had suffered many casualties through disease. Rather than retire directly to England for the winter, with his costly expedition resulting in the capture of only one town, Henry decided to march most of his army (roughly 9,000) through [[Normandy]] to the port of [[Calais]], the English stronghold in northern France, to demonstrate by his presence in the territory at the head of an army that his right to rule in the duchy was more than a mere abstract legal and historical claim.{{sfn|Hibbert|1971|p=67}} He also intended the manoeuvre as a deliberate provocation to battle aimed at [[Louis, Dauphin of France, Duke of Guyenne|the dauphin]], who had failed to respond to Henry's personal challenge to combat at Harfleur.{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=219}}\n\nThe French had raised an army during the siege which assembled around [[Rouen]]. This was not strictly a [[feudal]] army, but an army paid through a system similar to the English. The French hoped to raise 9,000 troops, but the army was not ready in time to relieve Harfleur. After Henry V marched to the north, the French moved to block them along the [[Somme river|River Somme]]. They were successful for a time, forcing Henry to move south, away from Calais, to find a [[Ford (crossing)|ford]]. The English finally crossed the Somme south of [[Péronne, Somme|Péronne]], at [[Béthencourt-sur-Somme|Béthencourt]] and [[Voyennes]] {{sfn|Wylie|Waugh|1914|p=118}}{{sfn|Seward|1999|p=162}} and resumed marching north. Without a river obstacle to defend, the French were hesitant to force a battle. They shadowed Henry's army while calling a ''semonce des nobles'',<ref>{{cite web |title= Living dictionary of the French language|date=25 May 2013| url=http://dvlf.uchicago.edu/mot/semonce|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214091454/http://dvlf.uchicago.edu/mot/semonce |archivedate=14 December 2013}} {{verify source|date=August 2013}}</ref> calling on local nobles to join the army. By 24 October, both armies faced each other for battle, but the French declined, hoping for the arrival of more troops. The two armies spent the night of 24 October on open ground. The next day the French initiated negotiations as a delaying tactic, but Henry ordered his army to advance and to start a battle that, given the state of his army, he would have preferred to avoid, or to fight defensively: that was how [[Battle of Crécy|Crécy]] and the other famous longbow victories had been won. The English had very little food, had marched {{convert|260|mi}} in two and a half weeks, were suffering from sickness such as [[dysentery]], and faced much larger numbers of well-equipped French men at arms. The French army blocked Henry's way to the safety of Calais, however, and delaying battle would only further weaken his tired army and allow more French troops to arrive.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=436–7}}\n\n==Battle==\n===The battlefield===\nThe location of the battle is not precisely fixed in contemporary accounts. Most authors believe it was fought in the narrow strip of open land formed between the woods of [[Tramecourt]] and Azincourt (close to the modern village of [[Azincourt]]). However, the lack of archaeological evidence at this traditional site has led to suggestions it was been fought to the west of Azincourt.<ref>Sutherland (2015)</ref>\n\n====English deployment====\n[[File:Map Agincort.svg|thumb|The battle of Agincourt]]\nEarly on the 25th, Henry deployed his army (approximately 1,500 [[man-at-arms|men-at-arms]] and 7,000 [[English longbow|longbowmen]]) across a {{convert|750|yd|sing=on}} part of the [[defile (geography)|defile]]. The army was organised into three \"battles\" or divisions: the [[Vanguard (military formation)|vanguard]], led by the [[Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York|Duke of York]]; the main battle led by Henry himself; and the [[Rear guard|rearguard]], led by [[Thomas de Camoys, 1st Baron Camoys|Lord Camoys]]. In addition, [[Thomas Erpingham|Sir Thomas Erpingham]], one of Henry's most experienced household knights, had a role in marshalling the archers.{{sfn|Barker|2005|pp=271, 290}} It is likely that the English adopted their usual battle line of longbowmen on either flank, with men-at-arms and knights in the centre. They might also have deployed some archers in the centre of the line. The English men-at-arms in plate and mail were placed shoulder to shoulder four deep. The English and Welsh archers on the flanks drove pointed wooden [[archer's stake|stakes]], or palings, into the ground at an angle to force [[cavalry]] to veer off. This use of stakes could have been inspired by the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] of 1396, where forces of the [[Ottoman Empire]] used the tactic against French cavalry.{{Ref label|c|c|none}}\n\nThe English made their confessions before the battle, as was customary.{{sfn|Curry|2006|p=166}} Henry, worried about the enemy launching surprise raids, and wanting his troops to remain focused, ordered all his men to spend the night before the battle in silence, on pain of having an ear cut off. He told his men that he would rather die in the coming battle than be captured and ransomed.{{sfn|Barker|2005|pp=267–8}}\n\nHenry made a speech emphasising the justness of his cause, and reminding his army of previous great defeats the kings of England had inflicted on the French. The [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] sources have him concluding the speech by telling his men that the French had boasted that they would cut off two fingers from the right hand of every archer, so that he could never draw a longbow again. Whether this was true is open to question; as previously noted, death was the normal fate of any soldier who could not be ransomed.{{sfn|Barker|2005|pp=283–4}}\n\n====French deployment====\nThe French force was not only larger than that of the English, their noble men-at-arms would have considered themselves superior to the large number of archers in the English army, whom the French (based on their experience in recent memory of using and facing archers) considered relatively insignificant.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=422}} For example, the chronicler Edmond de Dyntner stated that there were \"ten French nobles against one English\", ignoring the archers completely.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=422}} Several French accounts emphasise that the French leaders were so eager to defeat the English (and win the ransoms of the English men-at-arms) that they insisted on being in the first line; as one of the contemporary accounts put it: \"All the lords wanted to be in the vanguard, against the opinion of the constable and the experienced knights.\"{{sfn|Rogers|2008b|p=107}}\n\nThe French were arrayed in three lines or \"battles\". The first line was led by Constable d'Albret, [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Jean Le Maingre|Boucicault]], and the [[Charles, Duke of Orléans|Dukes of Orléans]] and [[John I, Duke of Bourbon|Bourbon]], with attached cavalry wings under the [[Louis, Count of Vendôme|Count of Vendôme]] and Sir Clignet de Brebant. The second line was commanded by the [[Edward III of Bar|Dukes of Bar]] and [[John I, Duke of Alençon|Alençon]] and the [[Philip II, Count of Nevers|Count of Nevers]]. The third line was under the [[Counts of Dammartin]] and Fauconberg.{{sfn|Barker|2005|pp=276–8}} The Burgundian chronicler, [[Jean de Wavrin]], writes that there were 8,000 men-at-arms, 4,000 archers and 1,500 crossbowmen in the vanguard, with two wings of 600 and 800 mounted men-at-arms, and the main battle having \"as many knights, esquires and archers as in the vanguard\", with the rearguard containing \"all of the rest of the men-at-arms\".<ref>[http://www.deremilitari.org/RESOURCES/SOURCES/agincourt.htm ''Battle of Agincourt 1415'', Wavrin]</ref> The Herald of Berry uses somewhat different figures of 4,800 men-at-arms in the first line, 3,000 men in the second line, with two \"wings\" containing 600 mounted men-at-arms each, and a total of \"10,000 men-at-arms\",<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Curry|2000|p=181}}.</ref> but does not mention a third line.\n\nThousands of troops appear to have been in the rearguard, containing servants and commoners whom the French were either unable or unwilling to deploy. Wavrin gives the total French army size as 50,000: \"They had plenty of archers and crossbowmen but nobody wanted to let them fire {{sic}}. The reason for this was that the site was so narrow that there was only enough room for the men-at-arms.\"<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Curry|2000|p=159}}.</ref> A different source says that the French did not even deploy 4,000 of the best crossbowmen \"on the pretext they had no need of their help\".<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Curry|2000|p=106}}.</ref>\n\n===Terrain===\nThe field of battle was arguably the most significant factor in deciding the outcome. The recently ploughed land hemmed in by dense woodland favoured the English, both because of its narrowness, and because of the thick mud through which the French knights had to walk.{{sfn|Wason|2004|p=74}}{{sfn|Holmes|1996|p=48}}\n\nAccounts of the battle describe the French engaging the English men-at-arms before being rushed from the sides by the longbowmen as the [[mêlée]] developed. The English account in the ''Gesta Henrici'' says: \"For when some of them, killed when battle was first joined, fall at the front, so great was the undisciplined violence and pressure of the mass of men behind them that the living fell on top of the dead, and others falling on top of the living were killed as well.\"{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=37}}\n\nAlthough the French initially pushed the English back, they became so closely packed that they were described as having trouble using their weapons properly. The French monk of St. Denis says: \"Their vanguard, composed of about 5,000 men, found itself at first so tightly packed that those who were in the third rank could scarcely use their swords,\"<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Curry|2000|p=107}}.</ref> and the Burgundian sources have a similar passage.\n\nAs the battle was fought on a recently ploughed field, and there had recently been heavy rain leaving it very muddy, it proved very tiring to walk through in full plate armour. The French monk of St. Denis describes the French troops as \"marching through the middle of the mud where they sank up to their knees. So they were already overcome with fatigue even before they advanced against the enemy\". The deep, soft mud particularly favoured the English force because, once knocked to the ground, the heavily armoured French knights had a hard time getting back up to fight in the mêlée. Barker states that some knights, encumbered by their armour, actually drowned in their helmets.{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=300}}\n\n===Fighting===\n====Opening moves====\n[[File:Morning of the Battle of Agincourt, 25th October 1415.PNG|thumb|''Morning of the Battle of Agincourt, 25th October 1415'', painted by Sir [[John Gilbert (painter)|John Gilbert]] in the 19th century]]\nOn the morning of 25 October, the French were still waiting for additional troops to arrive. The [[Anthony, Duke of Brabant|Duke of Brabant]] (about 2,000 men),{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=449}} the [[Louis II of Naples|Duke of Anjou]] (about 600 men),{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=449}} and the [[John VI, Duke of Brittany|Duke of Brittany]] (6,000 men, according to Monstrelet),{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=416}} were all marching to join the army.\n\nFor three hours after sunrise there was no fighting. Military textbooks of the time stated: \"Everywhere and on all occasions that foot soldiers march against their enemy face to face, those who march lose and those who remain standing still and holding firm win.\"{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=287}} On top of this, the French were expecting thousands of men to join them if they waited. They were blocking Henry's retreat, and were perfectly happy to wait for as long as it took. There had even been a suggestion that the English would run away rather than give battle when they saw that they would be fighting so many French princes.{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=288}}\n\nHenry's men, on the other hand, were already very weary from hunger, illness and marching. Even though Henry knew as well as the French did that his army would perform better on the defensive, he was eventually forced to take a calculated risk, and move his army further forward to start the battle.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=436–7}} This entailed abandoning his chosen position and pulling out, advancing, and then re-installing the long sharpened wooden stakes pointed outwards toward the enemy, which helped protect the longbowmen from cavalry charges.{{sfn|Keegan|1976|pp=90–1}} (The use of stakes was an innovation for the English: during the [[Battle of Crécy]], for example, the archers had been instead protected by pits and other obstacles.{{sfn|Bennett|1994}})\n\nThe tightness of the terrain also seems to have restricted the planned deployment of the French forces. The French had originally drawn up a battle plan that had archers and crossbowmen in front of their men-at-arms, with a cavalry force at the rear specifically designed to \"fall upon the archers, and use their force to break them,\"{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=273}} but in the event, the French archers and crossbowmen were deployed ''behind'' and to the sides of the men-at-arms (where they seem to have played almost no part, except possibly for an initial volley of arrows at the start of the battle). The cavalry force, which could have devastated the English line if it had attacked while they moved their stakes, charged only ''after'' the initial volley of arrows from the English. It is unclear whether the delay occurred because the French were hoping the English would launch a frontal assault (and were surprised when the English instead started shooting from their new defensive position), or whether the French mounted knights instead did not react quickly enough to the English advance. French chroniclers agree that when the mounted charge did come, it did not contain as many men as it should have; Gilles le Bouvier states that some had wandered off to warm themselves and others were walking or feeding their horses.{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=291}}\n\n====French cavalry attack====\nThe French cavalry, despite being somewhat disorganised and not at full numbers, charged towards the longbowmen, but it was a disaster, with the French knights unable to outflank the longbowmen (because of the encroaching woodland) and unable to charge through the forest of sharpened stakes that protected the archers. [[John Keegan]] argues that the longbows' main influence on the battle at this point was injuries to horses: armoured only on the head, many horses would have become dangerously out of control when struck in the back or flank from the high-elevation long range shots used as the charge started.{{sfn|Keegan|1976|pp=92–6}} The mounted charge and subsequent retreat churned up the already muddy terrain between the French and the English. Juliet Barker quotes a contemporary account by a monk of [[Saint Denis Basilica|St. Denis]] who reports how the wounded and panicking horses galloped through the advancing infantry, scattering them and trampling them down in their headlong flight from the battlefield.{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=293}}\n\n====Main French assault====\n[[File:King Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt, 1415.png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|King Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt, 1415, by Sir John Gilbert in the 19th century.]]\nThe plate armour of the French men-at-arms allowed them to close the 300 yards or so to the English lines while being under what the French monk of Saint Denis described as \"a terrifying hail of arrow shot\". A complete coat of plate was considered such good protection that shields were generally not used,{{sfn|Nicholson|2004|p=109}} although the Burgundian contemporary sources specifically distinguish between Frenchmen who used shields and those who did not, and Rogers has suggested that the front elements of the French force used axes and shields.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|p=90}} Modern historians are somewhat divided on how effective the longbow fire would have been against plate armour of the time, with some modern texts suggesting that arrows could not penetrate, especially the better quality steel armour, but others suggesting arrows could penetrate, especially the poorer quality [[wrought iron]] armour. Rogers suggests that the longbow could penetrate a wrought iron breastplate at short range and penetrate the thinner armour on the limbs even at {{convert|220|yd}}. He considers a knight in the best quality steel armour would have been more or less invulnerable to an arrow on the breastplate or top of the helmet, but would still have been vulnerable to shots hitting the limbs, particularly at close range.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|pp= 110–13}} In any case, to protect themselves as much as possible from the arrows, the French had to lower their visors and bend their helmeted heads to avoid being shot in the face—the eye and air-holes in their helmets were among the weakest points in the armour. This head lowered position restricted both their breathing and their vision. Then they had to walk a few hundred yards through thick mud, a press of comrades and wearing armour weighing {{convert|50|–|60|lb}}, gathering sticky clay all the way. Increasingly they had to walk around or over fallen comrades.{{sfn|Barker|2005|pp=297–298}}\n[[File:Vigiles du roi Charles VII 06.jpg|thumb|right|Miniature from Vigiles du roi Charles VII. The battle of Azincourt 1415.]]\nThe surviving French men-at-arms reached the front of the English line and pushed it back, with the longbowmen on the flanks continuing to shoot at point-blank range. When the archers ran out of arrows, they dropped their bows and using [[hatchet]]s, [[sword]]s and the [[mallet]]s they had used to drive their stakes in, attacked the now disordered, fatigued and wounded French men-at-arms massed in front of them. The French could not cope with the thousands of lightly armoured longbowmen assailants (who were much less hindered by the mud and weight of their armour) combined with the English men-at-arms. The impact of thousands of arrows, combined with the slog in heavy armour through the mud, the heat and lack of oxygen in plate armour with the visor down, and the crush of their numbers meant the French men-at-arms could \"scarcely lift their weapons\" when they finally engaged the English line.{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=159}} The exhausted French men-at-arms are described as being knocked to the ground by the English and then unable to get back up. As the [[Melee|mêlée]] developed, the French second line also joined the attack, but they too were swallowed up, with the narrow terrain meaning the extra numbers could not be used effectively. Rogers suggests that the French at the back of their deep formation would have been attempting to push forward and quite literally add their weight to the advance, without realising that they were hindering the ability of those at the front to manoeuvre and fight, actually pushing them into the English formation of lancepoints. After the initial wave, the French would have had to fight over and on the bodies of those who had fallen before them. In such a \"press\" of thousands of men, Rogers finds it plausible that a significant number could have suffocated in their armour, as is described by several sources, and is also known to have happened in other battles.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|pp=95–8}}\n\nThe French men-at-arms were taken prisoner or killed in the thousands. The fighting lasted about three hours, but eventually the leaders of the second line were killed or captured, as those of the first line had been. The English ''Gesta Henrici'' describes three great heaps of the slain around the three main English standards.{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=37}}\nAccording to contemporary English accounts, Henry was directly involved in the hand-to-hand fighting. Upon hearing that his youngest brother [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]] had been wounded in the groin, Henry took his household guard and stood over his brother, in the front rank of the fighting, until Humphrey could be dragged to safety. The king received an axe blow to the head, which knocked off a piece of the crown that formed part of his helmet.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=443}}\n\n====Attack on the English baggage train====\n[[File:King Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt.jpg|thumb|upright|1915 depiction of Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt : The King wears on this surcoat the Royal Arms of England, quartered with the Fleur de Lys of France as a symbol of his claim to the throne of France.]]\nThe only French success was an attack on the lightly protected English baggage train, with Ysembart d'Azincourt (leading a small number of men-at-arms and [[Squire|varlets]] plus about 600 peasants) seizing some of Henry's personal treasures, including a crown.{{sfn|Curry|2006|pp=207–9}} Whether this was part of a deliberate French plan or an act of local [[brigandage]] is unclear from the sources. Certainly, d'Azincourt was a local knight but he might have been chosen to lead the attack because of his local knowledge and the lack of availability of a more senior soldier.{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=308}} In some accounts the attack happened towards the end of the battle, and led the English to think they were being attacked from the rear. Barker, following the ''Gesta Henrici'', believed to have been written by an English chaplain who was actually in the baggage train, concludes that the attack happened at the ''start'' of the battle.{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=308}}\n\n====Henry orders the killing of the prisoners====\nRegardless of when the baggage assault happened, at some point after the initial English victory, Henry became alarmed that the French were regrouping for another attack. The ''Gesta Henrici'' places this after the English had overcome the onslaught of the French men-at-arms and the weary English troops were eyeing the French rearguard (\"in incomparable number and still fresh\"{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=37}}). Le Fèvre and Wavrin similarly say that it was signs of the French rearguard regrouping and \"marching forward in battle order\" which made the English think they were still in danger.{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=163}} A slaughter of the French prisoners ensued. It seems it was purely a decision of Henry, since the English knights found it contrary to [[chivalry]], and contrary to their interests to kill valuable hostages for whom it was commonplace to ask [[ransom]]. Henry threatened to hang whoever did not obey his orders.\n\nIn any event, Henry ordered the slaughter of what were perhaps several thousand French prisoners, sparing only the highest ranked (presumably those most likely to fetch a large ransom under the chivalric system of warfare). According to most chroniclers, Henry's fear was that the prisoners (who, in an unusual turn of events, actually outnumbered their captors) would realize their advantage in numbers, rearm themselves with the weapons strewn about the field and overwhelm the exhausted English forces. Contemporary chroniclers did not criticise him for it.{{sfn|Barker|2005|pp=302–305}} In his study of the battle, John Keegan {{sfn|Keegan|1976|pp=107–12}} argued that the main aim was not to actually kill the French knights but rather to terrorise them into submission and quell any possibility they might resume the fight, which would probably have caused the uncommitted French reserve forces to join the fray, as well. Such an event would have posed a risk to the still-outnumbered English and could have easily turned a stunning victory into a mutually-destructive defeat, as the English forces were now largely intermingled with the French and would have suffered grievously from the arrows of their own longbowmen had they needed to resume shooting. Keegan also speculated that due to the relatively low number of archers actually involved in killing the French knights (roughly 200 by his estimate), together with the refusal of the English knights to assist in a duty they saw as distastefully unchivalrous and combined with the sheer difficulty of killing such a large number of prisoners in such a short space of time, the actual number of French knights killed might not have even reached the hundreds before the reserves fled the field and Henry called an end to the slaughter.{{sfn|Keegan|1976|p=112}}\n\n===Aftermath===\nThe lack of reliable sources makes it impossible to give a precise figure for the French and English [[Casualty (person)|casualties]] (dead, wounded, taken prisoner). However, it is clear that though the English were outnumbered, their losses were far lower than those of the French. The French sources all give 4,000–10,000 French dead, with up to 1,600 English dead. The lowest ratio in these French sources has the French losing six times more men than the English. It has been possible to name at least 500 individuals from the French army killed in the battle and over 300 prisoners<ref>Curry & Mercer (2015), p.165</ref>. \n\nThe English sources vary between about 1,500 and 11,000 for the French dead, with English dead put at no more than 100.<ref>All figures on number of dead from table in {{harvnb|Curry|2000|p=12}}.</ref> Barker identifies from the available records \"at least\" 112 Englishmen killed in the fighting, including [[Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York]], a grandson of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]].{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=320}} One widely used estimate puts the English casualties at 450, not an insignificant number in an army of about 8,500, but far fewer than the thousands the French lost, nearly all of whom were killed or captured. Using the lowest French estimate of their own dead of 4,000 would imply a ratio of nearly 9 to 1 in favour of the English, or over 10 to 1 if the prisoners are included.<ref>Casualty estimates from the Religeux of St Denis and Jean Juvenal des Ursins given in {{harvnb|Curry|2000|p=12}}.</ref>\n\nThe French suffered heavily. Three [[duke]]s, at least eight [[count]]s, a [[viscount]], and an [[archbishop]] died, along with numerous other nobles. Of the great royal office holders, France lost her Constable, Admiral, Master of the Crossbowmen and ''prévôt'' of the marshals.{{sfn|Barker|2005|pp=''x'', 321, 323}} The ''[[bailli]]s'' of nine major northern towns were killed, often along with their sons, relatives and supporters. In the words of Juliet Barker, the battle \"cut a great swath through the natural leaders of French society in [[County of Artois|Artois]], [[Ponthieu]], [[Normandy]], [[Picardy]].\" {{sfn|Barker|2005|pp=322–3}} Estimates of the number of prisoners vary between 700 and 2,200, amongst them the [[Charles, duc d'Orléans|Duke of Orléans]] (the famous poet Charles d'Orléans) and [[Jean Le Maingre]] (known as Boucicault) [[Marshal of France]].{{sfn|Barker|2005|pp=337, 367, 368}}\n\nAlthough the victory had been militarily decisive, its impact was complex. It did not lead to further English conquests immediately as Henry's priority was to return to England, which he did on 16 November, to be received in triumph in London on the 23rd.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=475, 479}} Henry returned a conquering hero,{{Opinion|date=October 2017}} in the eyes of his subjects and European powers outside France, blessed by God.{{Opinion|date=October 2017}} It established the legitimacy of the Lancastrian monarchy and the future campaigns of Henry to pursue his \"rights and privileges\" in France.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=547–8}} Other benefits to the English were longer term. Very quickly after the battle, the fragile truce between the [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnac]] and [[Burgundian (party)|Burgundian]] factions broke down. The brunt of the battle had fallen on the Armagnacs and it was they who suffered the majority of senior casualties and carried the blame for the defeat. The Burgundians seized on the opportunity and within 10 days of the battle had mustered their armies and marched on Paris.{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=354}} This lack of unity in France allowed Henry eighteen months to prepare militarily and politically for a renewed campaign. When that campaign took place, it was made easier by the damage done to the political and military structures of Normandy by the battle.{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=381}}\n\n===Notable casualties===\n====French====\nNotable casualties (most named by [[Enguerrand de Monstrelet]]<ref>''The Chronicles of Enguerrad de Monstrelet'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=D-4DAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA343 Ch. 147])</ref>) include:<ref>[http://fr.geneawiki.com/index.php/1415 For a fuller list of French casualties, see]</ref>\n\nLeading officers:\n\n*[[Charles d'Albret|Charles I d'Albret]], [[Count of Dreux]], the [[Constable of France]]{{sfn|Walsingham|2005|p=412}}\n*[[Jacques de Châtillon de Dampière]], Lord of Dampierre, the [[Admiral of France]]\n*[[David de Rambures]], the Grand [[Master of Crossbowmen]] (along with his three youngest sons)\n*Guichard Dauphin, Master of the Royal Household\n\nThree dukes:\n*[[Antoine, Duke of Brabant|Antoine of Burgundy]], [[Duke of Brabant|Duke of Brabant and Limburg]], and [[Elisabeth, Duchess of Luxembourg|consort]] [[Duke of Luxembourg]]{{sfn|Walsingham|2005|p=412}} (a brother of [[John the Fearless]], [[Duke of Burgundy]])\n*[[John I of Alençon|John I]], [[Duke of Alençon]]-[[Count of Perche|Perche]],{{sfn|Walsingham|2005|p=412}} the second-in-command after d'Albret.\n*[[Edward III of Bar|Edward III]], [[Duke of Bar]]{{sfn|Walsingham|2005|p=412}} (along with his brother and nephew)\n\nSix counts (seven with d'Albret):\n\n*[[Philip II, Count of Nevers|Philip of Burgundy]], [[Count of Nevers]] and [[Counts and dukes of Rethel|Rethel]] (another brother of John the Fearless)\n*[[Frederick of Lorraine]], [[Count of Vaudémont]] (brother of [[Charles II, Duke of Lorraine|Charles II]], [[Duke of Lorraine]])\n*[[Robert of Bar, Count of Marle and Soissons|Robert of Bar]], Count of Marle and [[Count of Soissons|Soissons]] (nephew of Edward III, Duke of Bar).\n*John VI, [[Count of Roucy]],\n*Edward II, Count of Grandpré\n*Henry II, Count of Blâmont\n\nand some 90 bannerets and others, including:\n\n* Jean de Montaigu, [[Archbishop of Sens]]\n* [[John of Bar]], Lord of Puisaye (brother of Edward III of Bar)\n* [[Jean I de Croÿ]], Lord of Croÿ-d'Araines (along with two of his sons, John and Archambaud)\n* Jean de Béthune, Lord of Marueil\n* Gallois de Fougières, [[Provost Marshal]], commemorated as the first French [[gendarme]] to lose his life in battle.<ref>Gilliot (2015)</ref>\n* [[Jean V de Hangest]] - Consular to the [[Grand Chamberlain of France]] \n\n====English====\nNotable casualties included:\n* [[Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York]] (b. 1373)<ref>Rosemary Horrox, ‘Edward, second duke of York (c.1373–1415)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22356, accessed 14 March 2011]</ref>\n* [[Michael de la Pole, 3rd Earl of Suffolk]]<ref>Simon Walker, ‘Pole, Michael de la, second earl of Suffolk (1367/8–1415)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22453, accessed 14 March 2011]</ref>\n* [[Dafydd Gam]] (Davy Gam) Welsh hero who reputedly saved Henry V's life at Agincourt<ref>T.

The 1911 ''Britannica'' used somewhat different figures of 6,000 archers, 1,000 men-at-arms and \"a few thousands of other foot\" for the English, with the French outnumbering them by \"at least four times\".{{sfn|EB|1911|p=375}}\n\nWith one of the lowest estimates for the size of the French army and also one of the highest estimates for the size of the English army, Curry is currently in a minority in suggesting that the ratio of forces were as near equal as four to three. While not necessarily agreeing with the exact numbers Curry uses, some historians have however given support to her assertion that the French army was much smaller than traditionally thought, and the English somewhat bigger. Bertrand Schnerb, a professor of medieval history at the University of Lille, has said that he thinks the French probably had 12,000–15,000 troops.{{sfn|Glanz|2009}} Ian Mortimer, in his 2009 book ''1415: Henry V's Year of Glory'', notes how Curry \"minimises French numbers (by limiting her figures to those in the basic army and a few specific additional companies) and maximises English numbers (by assuming the numbers sent home from Harfleur were no greater than sick lists)\", but agrees that previous estimates have exaggerated the odds, and suggests that \"the most extreme imbalance which is credible is fifteen thousand French troops against 8,100 English: a ratio of about two-to-one\".{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=566}}\n\nHowever, Clifford J. Rogers, professor of history at the United States Military Academy at West Point, has recently argued that archival records are too incomplete to substantially change his view that the English were outnumbered about 4–1.{{sfn|Glanz|2009}}{{sfn|Rogers|2008a|pp=114–21}} Juliet Barker also disagrees with Curry's arguments in the acknowledgements section of her 2005 book on Agincourt, saying: \"Surviving administrative records on both sides, but especially the French, are simply too incomplete to support [Curry's] assertion that nine thousand English were pitted against an army only twelve thousand strong. And if the differential really was as low as three to four then this makes a nonsense of the course of the battle as described by eyewitnesses and contemporaries.\"{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=''xvi''}}\n\nThose supporting a greater imbalance have generally put more store by contemporary (and especially eyewitness) accounts. The ''Gesta Henrici'' gives plausible figures for the English of 5,000 archers and 900 men-at-arms, but Mortimer notes it is \"wildly inaccurate\" in stating the English were outnumbered 30–1, and there have also been doubts as to how much it was written as propaganda for Henry V. The proportions also seem incorrect, as from surviving records we know that Henry set out with about four times as many archers as men-at-arms, not five and a half times as many. Those who have supported the Gesta figures for the English army have generally thought that although the English army may have left Harfleur with eight or nine thousand men, it is plausible that after weeks of campaigning and disease in hostile territory they would have lost two or three thousand fighting men; however Mortimer states: \"Despite the trials of the march, Henry had lost very few men to illness or death; and we have independent testimony that no more than 160 had been captured on the way.\" {{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=565}}\n\nAs Mortimer notes, the Burgundian numbers for the size of the French vanguard of 8,000 men-at-arms in the vanguard with 1,400 (or 2,400) men-at-arms in the wings correspond roughly with the figures of ten thousand men-at-arms recorded by the duke of Berry's herald. The Burgundians also recorded 4,000 archers and 1,500 crossbowmen in the \"vanguard\", which would suggest \"fourteen or fifteen thousand fighting men\".{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=565}} (It should be noted that the Burgundians actually give the total size of the French army as an implausible 50,000,{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=12}} and the numbers they use do not correspond closely to the odds they describe. Using very similar numbers, Jean Le Fevre states that the English were outnumbered 3–1, whereas Wavrin states that the English were outnumbered 6–1.{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=157}})\n\nOne particular cause of confusion may have been the number of servants on both sides. Mortimer suggests that because there were a much higher proportion of men-at-arms on the French side, the number of non-combatants was much higher. Each man-at-arms could be expected to have a page, who would have ridden one of his spare horses. If the French army had an extra 10,000 mounted men (as opposed to only 1,500 extra for the English), then \"the English probably did see an army about three times the size of their own fighting force\".{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=421–2}}\n\nIt is open to debate whether these should all be counted as non-combatants; Rogers (for example) accepts that the French probably had about 10,000 men-at-arms, but explicitly includes one \"gros valet\" (an armed, armoured and mounted military servant) per French man-at-arms in his calculation of the odds.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|pp=60–2}}\n\n==Popular representations==\n[[File:Agincourtcarol.jpg|thumb|The 15th century [[Agincourt Carol]]]]\n;Music\nSoon after the English victory at Agincourt, a number of popular folk songs were created about the battle, the most famous being the \"[[Agincourt Carol]]\", produced in the first half of the 15th century.{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=280–3}} Other ballads followed, including \"[[King Henry Fifth's Conquest of France]]\", raising the popular prominence of particular events mentioned only in passing by the original chroniclers, such as the gift of tennis balls before the campaign.{{sfn|Woolf|2003|p=323}}\n\n;Literature\nThe most famous cultural depiction of the battle today, however, is through [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', written in 1599. The play focuses on the pressures of kingship, the tensions between how a king should ''appear'' – chivalric, honest, and just – and how a king must sometimes ''act'' – [[Machiavellian]] and ruthless.{{sfn|Cantor|2006|p=15}} Shakespeare illustrates these tensions by depicting Henry's decision to kill some of the French prisoners, whilst attempting to justify it and distance himself from the event. This moment of the battle is portrayed both as a break with the traditions of chivalry and as key example of the paradox of kingship.{{sfn|Cantor|2006|pp=21–2}} \n\nShakespeare's depiction of the battle also plays on the theme of modernity. He contrasts the modern, English king and his army with the medieval, chivalric, older model of the French.{{sfn|Cantor|2006|p=20}} \n\nShakespeare's play presented Henry as leading a truly English force into battle, playing on the importance of the link between the monarch and the common soldiers in the fight.{{sfn|Cantor|2006|p=16}} The original play does not, however, feature any scenes of the actual battle itself, leading critic Rose Zimbardo to characterise it as \"full of warfare, yet empty of conflict.\"{{sfn|Hatchuel|2008|p=193}}\n\nThe play introduced the famous [[St Crispin's Day Speech]], considered one of Shakespeare's most heroic speeches, in which Henry delivers movingly to his soldiers just before the battle, urging his \"band of brothers\" to stand together in the forthcoming fight.{{sfn|Margolies|2006|p=149}} Critic David Margolies describes how it \"oozes honour, military glory, love of country and self-sacrifice\", and forms one of the first instances of English literature linking solidarity and comradeship to success in battle.{{sfn|Margolies|2006|p=149}}{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=31}} Partially as a result, the battle was used as a metaphor at the beginning of the [[First World War]], when the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]]'s attempts to stop the German advances were widely likened to it.{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=183}}\n;Films\nShakespeare's version of the battle of Agincourt has been turned into (several minor and) two major films, starring [[Laurence Olivier]] in [[Henry V (1944 film)|1944]] and [[Kenneth Branagh]] in [[Henry V (1989 film)|1989]]. Made just prior to the invasion of Normandy, Olivier's rendition gives the battle what Sarah Hatchuel has termed an \"exhilarating and heroic\" tone, with an artificial, cinematic look to the battle scenes.{{sfn|Hatchuel|2008|pp=194–5}} Branagh's version gives a longer, more [[Realism (arts)|realist]] portrayal of the battle itself, drawing on both historical sources and images from the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and [[Falkland War]]s.{{sfn|Hatchuel|2008|p=195}} In his film adaptation, Peter Babakitis uses digital effects to exaggerate realist features during the battle scenes, producing a more ''[[Experimental film|avant-garde]]'' interpretation of the fighting at Agincourt.{{sfn|Hatchuel|2008|p=200}} {{Clarify| reason=From the title of the cited source I infer Babakitis is a third director, but he's not earlier mentioned, and the reader has no idea who he is or when his film came out.|date=February 2013}}\n;Mock trial\nThe battle remains an important symbol in popular culture. For example, a mock trial of Henry V for the crimes associated with the slaughter of the prisoners was held in Washington, D.C. in March 2010, drawing from both the historical record and Shakespeare's play. Participating as judges were Justices [[Samuel Alito]] and [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]. The trial ranged widely over whether there was just cause for war and not simply the prisoner issue. Although an audience vote was \"too close to call\", Henry was unanimously found guilty by the court on the basis of \"evolving standards of civil society\".<ref name=\"mock-trial-cspan\">{{cite web | url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/id/221111 | title=Judgment at Agincourt | date=16 March 2010 | website=[[C-SPAN]] }} link to video</ref><ref name=\"mock-trial-cd\">{{cite web | url=http://dctheatrescene.com/2010/03/18/high-court-rules-for-french-at-agincourt/ | title=High Court Rules for French at Agincourt | website=DC Theater Scene | first=Tim | last=Treanor | date=18 March 2010 }}</ref><ref name=\"mock-trial-lawj\">{{cite web | url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202446381186 | title=High Court Justices, Legal Luminaries Debate Shakespeare's 'Henry V' | last=Jones | first=Andy | website=[[National Law Journal]] | date=8 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n{{wide image|AGINCOURT.hto3.jpg|1100px|Battlefield today|left}}\n\n==Agincourt today==\n[[File:Agincourt Memorial.jpg|thumb|right|Agincourt Memorial]]\n[[File:Agincourt archers memorial.jpg|thumb|A list of English archers killed at Agincourt, as recorded in the village's museum]]\nThere is a modern museum in Agincourt village dedicated to the battle.<ref>[http://illucolor.fr/7_vallees_comm/Azincourt/index.html Agincourt Museum]</ref> The museum lists the names of combatants of both sides who died in the battle.\n\n==See also==\n* [[V sign]], for more on the \"two-finger salute\" which legends claim derives from the gestures of longbowmen fighting in the English army at the battle of Agincourt.\n\n==Notes and references==\n===Notes===\n* '''a.''' {{Note label|a|a|none}}Pronunciation: The story of the battle has been retold many times in English, from the fifteenth-century [[Agincourt Carol|Agincourt song]] onwards, and an English pronunciation of {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|dʒ|ᵻ|ŋ|k|ɔːr|t}} has become established.

It was fought between the citizens of [[History of Athens|Athens]], aided by [[Plataea]], and a [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] force commanded by [[Datis]] and [[Artaphernes (son of Artaphernes)|Artaphernes]]. The battle was the culmination of the first attempt by Persia, under King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius I]], to subjugate [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. The Greek army decisively defeated the more numerous Persians, marking a turning point in the [[Greco-Persian Wars]].\n\nThe first Persian invasion was a response to Athenian involvement in the [[Ionian Revolt]], when Athens and [[Eretria]] had sent a force to support the cities of [[Ionia]] in their attempt to overthrow Persian rule. The Athenians and Eretrians had succeeded in capturing and burning [[Sardis]], but they were then forced to retreat with heavy losses. In response to this raid, Darius swore to burn down Athens and Eretria. According to [[Herodotus]], Darius had his bow brought to him and then shot an arrow \"upwards towards heaven\", saying as he did so: \"Zeus, that it may be granted me to take vengeance upon the Athenians!\". Herodotus further writes that Darius charged one of his servants to say \"Master, remember the Athenians\" three times before dinner each day.<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hh/hh5100.htm Herodotus Book 5: Terpsichore, 105] \"...he inquired into who the Athenians were; and when he had been informed, he asked for his bow, and having received it and placed an arrow upon the string, he discharged it upwards towards heaven, and as he shot into the air he said: \"Zeus, that it may be granted me to take vengeance upon the Athenians!\" Having so said he charged one of his attendants, that when dinner was set before the king he should say always three times: \"Master, remember the Athenians.\"\"</ref>\n\nAt the time of the battle, [[Sparta]] and Athens were the two largest city-states in Greece. Once the Ionian revolt was finally crushed by the Persian victory at the [[Battle of Lade]] in 494 BC, Darius began plans to subjugate Greece. In 490 BC, he sent a naval task force under Datis and Artaphernes across the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], to subjugate the [[Cyclades]], and then to make punitive attacks on Athens and Eretria. Reaching [[Euboea]] in mid-summer after a successful campaign in the Aegean, the Persians proceeded to besiege and capture Eretria. The Persian force then sailed for [[Attica]], landing in the bay near the town of [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]]. The Athenians, joined by a small force from Plataea, marched to Marathon, and succeeded in blocking the two exits from the plain of Marathon. The Athenians also sent a message asking for support to the Spartans. When the messenger arrived in Sparta, the Spartans were involved in a religious festival and gave this as a reason for not coming to aid of the Athenians.\n\nThe Athenians and their allies chose a location for the battle, with marshes and mountainous terrain, that prevented the [[Achaemenid Empire#Cavalry|Persian cavalry]] from joining the main Persian army. [[Miltiades]], the Athenian general, ordered a general attack against the Persian [[sparabara|infantry-bowmen]]. He reinforced his flanks, luring the Persians' best fighters into his center. The inward wheeling flanks enveloped the Persians, routing them. The Persian army broke in panic towards their ships, and large numbers were slaughtered. The defeat at Marathon marked the end of the first Persian invasion of Greece, and the Persian force retreated to Asia. Darius then began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition. After Darius died, his son [[Xerxes I]] restarted the preparations for a [[Second Persian invasion of Greece|second invasion of Greece]], which finally began in 480 BC.\n\nThe Battle of Marathon was a watershed in the Greco-Persian wars, showing the Greeks that the Persians could be beaten; the eventual Greek triumph in these wars can be seen to begin at Marathon. The battle also showed the Greeks that they were able to win battles without the Spartans, as they had heavily relied on Sparta previously. This win was largely due to the Athenians, and Marathon raised Greek esteem of them. Since the following two hundred years saw the rise of the [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] civilization, which has been enduringly influential in western society, the Battle of Marathon is often seen as a pivotal moment in Mediterranean and European history.\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Main article|Herodotus}}\n\nThe main source for the Greco-Persian Wars is the Greek historian [[Herodotus]]. Herodotus, who has been called the \"Father of History\",<ref>Cicero, On the Laws I, 5</ref> was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, Asia Minor (then under Persian overlordship). He wrote his ''Enquiries'' (Greek – ''Historia''; English – ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|(The) Histories]]'') around 440–430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ended in 450 BC).<ref name = hxvi/> Herodotus's approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he does seem to have invented \"history\" as we know it.<ref name = hxvi/> As Holland has it: \"For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to manifest destiny, but rather explanations he could verify personally.\"<ref name = hxvi>Holland, pp. xvi–xvii.</ref>\n\nSome subsequent ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, criticised Herodotus, starting with [[Thucydides]].<ref>Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, e.g., [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200&layout=&loc=1.22 I, 22]</ref><ref name = Fin15>Finley, p. 15.</ref> Nevertheless, Thucydides chose to begin his history where Herodotus left off (at the [[Siege of Sestos]]), and may therefore have felt that Herodotus's history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting.<ref name = Fin15/> [[Plutarch]] criticised Herodotus in his essay ''[[On the malice of Herodotus]]'', describing Herodotus as \"''Philobarbaros''\" (barbarian-lover), for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that Herodotus might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed.<ref>Holland, p. xxiv.</ref> A negative view of Herodotus was passed on to Renaissance Europe, though he remained well read.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.loyno.edu/~history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm#1|title=Herodotus: Father of History, Father of Lies|accessdate=2008-01-18|author=David Pipes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080127105636/http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm |archivedate = January 27, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> However, since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by archaeological finds which have repeatedly confirmed his version of events.<ref name = h377>Holland, p. 377.</ref> The prevailing modern view is that Herodotus generally did a remarkable job in his ''Historia'', but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with skepticism.<ref name = h377/> Nevertheless, there are still some historians who believe Herodotus made up much of his story.<ref>Fehling, pp. 1–277.</ref>\n\nThe Sicilian historian [[Diodorus Siculus]], writing in the 1st century BC in his ''[[Bibliotheca historica|Bibliotheca Historica]]'', also provides an account of the Greco-Persian wars, partially derived from the earlier Greek historian [[Ephorus]]. This account is fairly consistent with Herodotus's.<ref>Diodorus Siculus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084&layout=&loc=11.28 Bibliotheca Historica]</ref> The Greco-Persian wars are also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including Plutarch, [[Ctesias of Cnidus]], and are alluded by other authors, such as the playwright [[Aeschylus]]. Archaeological evidence, such as the [[Serpent Column]], also supports some of Herodotus's specific claims.<ref>Note to Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=9.81.1 IX, 81]</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main article|Greco-Persian Wars|Ionian Revolt|First Persian invasion of Greece}}\n\n[[File:Map Greco-Persian Wars-en.svg|thumb|300px|right|A map showing the Greek world at the time of the battle]]\n\nThe first Persian invasion of Greece had its immediate roots in the [[Ionian Revolt]], the earliest phase of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. However, it was also the result of the longer-term interaction between the Greeks and Persians. In 500 BC the Persian Empire was still relatively young and highly expansionistic, but prone to revolts amongst its subject peoples.<ref name = h47>Holland, pp. 47–55</ref><ref name = h58>Holland, pp. 58–62</ref><ref name=\"h203\"/> Moreover, the Persian King Darius was a [[usurper]], and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule.<ref name = h47/> Even before the Ionian Revolt, Darius had begun to expand the empire into Europe, subjugating [[Thrace]], and forcing [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]] to become [[Achaemenid Macedonia|a vassal]] of Persia.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|p=343}}  Attempts at further expansion into the politically fractious world of ancient Greece may have been inevitable.<ref name = h58/> However, the Ionian Revolt had directly threatened the integrity of the Persian empire, and the states of mainland Greece remained a potential menace to its future stability.<ref name = h171>Holland, 171–78</ref> Darius thus resolved to subjugate and pacify Greece and the Aegean, and to punish those involved in the Ionian Revolt.<ref name = h171/><ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=5.105 V, 105]</ref>\n\nThe Ionian Revolt had begun with an unsuccessful [[Siege of Naxos (499 BC)|expedition]] against [[Siege of Naxos (499 BC)|Naxos]], a joint venture between the Persian satrap [[Artaphernes]] and the [[Miletus|Milesian]] tyrant [[Aristagoras]].<ref name = h154>Holland, pp. 154–57</ref> In the aftermath, Artaphernes decided to remove Aristagoras from power, but before he could do so, Aristagoras abdicated, and declared Miletus a democracy.<ref name = h154/> The other [[Ionia]]n cities followed suit, ejecting their Persian-appointed tyrants, and declaring themselves democracies.<ref name = h154/><ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=5.98 V, 97]</ref> Aristagoras then appealed to the states of mainland Greece for support, but only [[History of Athens|Athens]] and [[Eretria]] offered to send troops.<ref name = h157>Holland, pp. 157–61</ref>\n\nThe involvement of Athens in the Ionian Revolt arose from a complex set of circumstances, beginning with the establishment of the [[Athenian Democracy]] in the late 6th century BC.<ref name = h157/>\n\nIn 510 BC, with the aid of [[Cleomenes I]], King of [[Sparta]], the Athenian people had expelled [[Hippias (tyrant)|Hippias]], the [[tyrant]] ruler of Athens.<ref name = V65>Herodotus  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=5.65 V, 65]</ref> With Hippias's father [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratus]], the family had ruled for 36 out of the previous 50 years and fully intended to continue Hippias's rule.<ref name = V65/> Hippias fled to [[Sardis]] to the court of the Persian [[satrap]], [[Artaphernes]] and promised control of Athens to the Persians if they were to help restore him.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=5.97 V, 96]</ref> In the meantime, Cleomenes helped install a pro-Spartan tyranny under [[Isagoras]] in Athens, in opposition to [[Cleisthenes]], the leader of the traditionally powerful [[Alcmaeonidae]] family, who considered themselves the natural heirs to the rule of Athens.<ref name = h131>Holland, pp. 131–32</ref> Cleisthenes, however, found himself being politically defeated by a coalition led by Isagoras and decided to change the rules of the game by appealing to the ''demos'' (the people), in effect making them a new faction in the political arena. This tactic succeeded, but the Spartan King, Cleomenes I, returned at the request of Isagoras and so Cleisthenes, the Alcmaeonids and other prominent Athenian families were exiled from Athens. When Isagoras attempted to create a narrow oligarchic government, the Athenian people, in a spontaneous and unprecedented move, expelled Cleomenes and Isagoras.<ref name = \"h133\">Holland, pp. 133–36</ref> Cleisthenes was thus restored to Athens (507 BC), and at breakneck speed began to reform the state with the aim of securing his position.  The result was not actually a democracy or a real civic state, but he enabled the development of a fully democratic government, which would emerge in the next generation as the demos realized its power.<ref>For a full account and analysis see R.M. Berthold, Dare To Struggle. The History and Society of Greece (2009) pp. 81–94</ref>  The new-found freedom and self-governance of the Athenians meant that they were thereafter exceptionally hostile to the return of the tyranny of Hippias, or any form of outside subjugation, by Sparta, Persia, or anyone else.<ref name = \"h133\"/>\n\n[[File:Darius-Vase.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Darius I of Persia, as imagined by a Greek painter, 4th century BC]]\n\nCleomenes was not pleased with events, and marched on Athens with the Spartan army.<ref name = h136>Holland, pp. 136–38</ref> Cleomenes's attempts to restore Isagoras to Athens ended in a debacle, but fearing the worst, the Athenians had by this point already sent an embassy to Artaphernes in Sardis, to request aid from the Persian empire.<ref name = h142>Holland, p. 142</ref> Artaphernes requested that the Athenians give him an '[[earth and water]]', a traditional token of submission, to which the Athenian ambassadors acquiesced.<ref name = h142/> They were, however, severely censured for this when they returned to Athens.<ref name = h142/> At some later point Cleomenes instigated a plot to restore Hippias to the rule of Athens.

They then headed south down the coast of Attica, en route to complete the final objective of the campaign—punish Athens.\n\n== Prelude ==\n[[File:Battle of Marathon Initial Situation.png|250px|thumb|Initial disposition of forces at Marathon]]\n[[File:BeachedShipsMarathon.jpg|thumb|250px|A picture reconstructing the beached Persian ships at Marathon before the battle]]\n\nThe Persians sailed down the coast of Attica, and landed at the bay of Marathon, roughly {{convert|25|mi|km}} from Athens, on the advice of the exiled Athenian tyrant Hippias (who had accompanied the expedition).<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=6.102 VI, 102]</ref> Under the guidance of [[Miltiades]], the Athenian general with the greatest experience of fighting the Persians, the Athenian army marched quickly to block the two exits from the plain of Marathon, and prevent the Persians moving inland.<ref name = h187/><ref>Cornelius Nepos, Miltiades, IV</ref> At the same time, Athens's greatest runner, [[Pheidippides]] (or Philippides in some accounts) had been sent to Sparta to request that the Spartan army march to the aid of Athens.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231011;layout=;loc=6.106.1 VI, 105]</ref> Pheidippides arrived during the festival of ''[[Carneia]]'', a sacrosanct period of peace, and was informed that the Spartan army could not march to war until the full moon rose; Athens could not expect reinforcement for at least ten days.<ref name = h187>Holland, pp. 187–90</ref> The Athenians would have to hold out at Marathon for the time being, although they were reinforced by the full muster of 1,000 [[hoplite]]s from the small city of [[Plataea]]; a gesture which did much to steady the nerves of the Athenians,<ref name = h187/> and won unending Athenian gratitude to Plataea.\n\nFor approximately five days the armies therefore confronted each other across the plain of Marathon in stalemate.<ref name = h187/> The flanks of the Athenian camp were protected either by a grove of trees, or an ''abbatis'' of stakes (depending on the exact reading).<ref>Cornelius Nepos, Miltiades, VI</ref><ref name = L56>Lazenby, p. 56</ref> Since every day brought the arrival of the Spartans closer, the delay worked in favor of the Athenians.<ref name = h187/> There were ten Athenian ''[[strategos|strategoi]]'' (generals) at Marathon, elected by each of the ten [[phyle|tribes]] that the Athenians were divided into; Miltiades was one of these.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231009;layout=;loc=6.104.1 VI, 103]</ref> In addition, in overall charge, was the War-[[Archon]] ([[polemarch]]), [[Callimachus (polemarch)|Callimachus]], who had been elected by the whole citizen body.<ref name = VI109>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231009;layout=;loc=6.104.1 VI, 109]</ref> Herodotus suggests that command rotated between the ''strategoi'', each taking in turn a day to command the army.<ref name = VI110>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231016;layout=;loc=6.109.1 VI, 110]</ref> He further suggests that each ''strategos'', on his day in command, instead deferred to Miltiades.<ref name = VI110/> In Herodotus's account, Miltiades is keen to attack the Persians (despite knowing that the Spartans are coming to aid the Athenians), but strangely, chooses to wait until his actual day of command to attack.<ref name = VI110/> This passage is undoubtedly problematic; the Athenians had little to gain by attacking before the Spartans arrived,<ref name = L59/> and there is no real evidence of this rotating generalship.<ref name = L57>Lazenby, pp. 57–59</ref> There does, however, seem to have been a delay between the Athenian arrival at Marathon, and the battle; Herodotus, who evidently believed that Miltiades was eager to attack, may have made a mistake whilst seeking to explain this delay.<ref name = L57/>\n\nAs is discussed [[#Strategic and tactical considerations|below]], the reason for the delay was probably simply that neither the Athenians nor the Persians were willing to risk battle initially.<ref name = L59>Lazenby, pp. 59–62</ref><ref name = \"h191\">Holland, pp. 191–95</ref> This then raises the question of why the battle occurred when it did. Herodotus explicitly tells us that the Greeks attacked the Persians (and the other sources confirm this), but it is not clear why they did this before the arrival of the Spartans.<ref name = L59/> There are two main theories to explain this.<ref name = L59/>\n\nThe first theory is that the Persian cavalry left Marathon for an unspecified reason, and that the Greeks moved to take advantage of this by attacking. This theory is based on the absence of any mention of cavalry in Herodotus' account of the battle, and an entry in the ''[[Suda]]'' dictionary.<ref name = L59/> The entry ''χωρίς ἰππεῖς'' (\"without cavalry\") is explained thus: <blockquote>The cavalry left. When Datis surrendered and was ready for retreat, the Ionians climbed the trees and gave the Athenians the signal that the cavalry had left. And when [[Miltiades]] realized that, he attacked and thus won. From there comes the above-mentioned quote, which is used when someone breaks ranks before battle.<ref>[[Suda]], entry ''Without cavalry''</ref></blockquote> There are many variations of this theory, but perhaps the most prevalent is that the cavalry were completing the time-consuming process of re-embarking on the ships, and were to be sent by sea to attack (undefended) Athens in the rear, whilst the rest of the Persians pinned down the Athenian army at Marathon.<ref name = h187/> This theory therefore utilises Herodotus' suggestion that after Marathon, the Persian army began to re-embark, intending to sail around Cape Sounion to attack Athens directly.<ref name = VI115>Herodotus [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0016.tlg001.perseus-eng1:6.115.1 VI, 115]</ref> Thus, this re-embarcation would have occurred ''before'' the battle (and indeed have triggered the battle).<ref name = h191/>\n\nThe second theory is simply that the battle occurred because the Persians finally moved to attack the Athenians.<ref name = L59/> Although this theory has the Persians moving to the ''strategic'' offensive, this can be reconciled with the traditional account of the Athenians attacking the Persians by assuming that, seeing the Persians advancing, the Athenians took the ''tactical'' offensive, and attacked them.<ref name = L59/> Obviously, it cannot be firmly established which theory (if either) is correct. However, both theories imply that there was some kind of Persian activity which occurred on or about the fifth day which ultimately triggered the battle.<ref name = L59/> It is also possible that both theories are correct: when the Persians sent the cavalry by ship to attack Athens, they simultaneously sent their infantry to attack at Marathon, triggering the Greek counterattack.\n\n=== Date of the battle ===\nHerodotus mentions for several events a date in the [[lunisolar calendar]], of which each Greek city-state used a variant.  Astronomical computation allows us to derive an absolute date in the [[proleptic Julian calendar]] which is much used by historians as the chronological frame. [[Philipp August Böckh]] in 1855  concluded that the battle took place on September 12, 490 BC in the Julian calendar, and this is the conventionally accepted date.<ref name = date/>  However, this depends on when exactly the Spartans held their festival and it is possible that the Spartan calendar was one month ahead of that of Athens.

In order to face the Persians in battle, the Athenians had to summon all available [[hoplite]]s;<ref name = h187/> and even then they were still probably outnumbered at least 2 to 1.<ref name = L56/> Furthermore, raising such a large army had denuded Athens of defenders, and thus any secondary attack in the Athenian rear would cut the army off from the city; and any direct attack on the city could not be defended against.<ref name = h191/> Still further, defeat at Marathon would mean the complete defeat of Athens, since no other Athenian army existed. The Athenian strategy was therefore to keep the Persian army pinned down at Marathon, blocking both exits from the plain, and thus preventing themselves from being outmaneuvered.<ref name = h187/> However, these disadvantages were balanced by some advantages. The Athenians initially had no need to seek battle, since they had managed to confine the Persians to the plain of Marathon. Furthermore, time worked in their favour, as every day brought the arrival of the Spartans closer.<ref name = h187/><ref name = L59/> Having everything to lose by attacking, and much to gain by waiting, the Athenians remained on the defensive in the run up to the battle.<ref name = L59/> Tactically, hoplites were vulnerable to attacks by cavalry, and since the Persians had substantial numbers of cavalry, this made any offensive maneuver by the Athenians even more of a risk, and thus reinforced the defensive strategy of the Athenians.<ref name = h191/>\n\nThe Persian strategy, on the other hand, was probably principally determined by tactical considerations. The Persian infantry was evidently lightly armoured, and no match for hoplites in a head-on confrontation (as would be demonstrated at the later battles of [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] and [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]].<ref name = L256>Lazenby, p. 256</ref>) Since the Athenians seem to have taken up a strong defensive position at Marathon, the Persian hesitance was probably a reluctance to attack the Athenians head-on.<ref name = h191/>\n\nWhatever event eventually triggered the battle, it obviously altered the strategic or tactical balance sufficiently to induce the Athenians to attack the Persians. If the first theory is correct (see [[#Prelude|above]]), then the absence of cavalry removed the main Athenian tactical disadvantage, and the threat of being outflanked made it imperative to attack.<ref name = h191/> Conversely, if the second theory is correct, then the Athenians were merely reacting to the Persians attacking them.<ref name = L59/> Since the Persian force obviously contained a high proportion of missile troops, a static defensive position would have made little sense for the Athenians;<ref>Lazenby, p. 67</ref> the strength of the hoplite was in the melee, and the sooner that could be brought about, the better, from the Athenian point of view.<ref name = L256/> If the second theory is correct, this raises the further question of why the Persians, having hesitated for several days, then attacked. There may have been several strategic reasons for this; perhaps they were aware (or suspected) that the Athenians were expecting reinforcements.<ref name = L59/> Alternatively, since they may have felt the need to force some kind of victory—they could hardly remain at Marathon indefinitely.<ref name = L59/>\n\n== Battle ==\n[[File:They crashed into Persian army with tremendous force.jpg|thumb|\"They crashed into the Persian army with tremendous force\", [https://archive.org/stream/storyofgreecetol00macg#page/136/mode/2up illustration] by Walter Crane in Mary Macgregor, ''The Story of Greece Told to Boys and Girls'', London: T.C. & E.C.

Most scholars believe that the Greeks had better equipment and used superior tactics. According to Herodotus, the Greeks were better equipped. They did not use bronze upper body armour at this time, but that of leather or linen. The [[phalanx]] formation proved successful, because the hoplites had a long tradition in hand-to-hand combat, whereas the Persian soldiers were accustomed to a very different kind of conflict. At Marathon, the Athenians thinned their centre in order to make their army equal in length to the Persian army,<ref>Herod. Histories 6.111,3</ref> not as a result of a tactical planning.<ref>Lazenby 258</ref> It seems that the Persian centre tried to return, realizing that their wings had broken, and was caught in the flanks by the victorious Greek wings. Lazenby (1993)  believes that the ultimate reason for the Greek success was the courage the Greeks displayed:\n<blockquote> Marathon was won because ordinary, amateur soldiers found the courage to break into a trot when the arrows begun to fall, instead of grinding to a halt, and when surprisingly the enemy wings fled, not to take the easy way out and follow them, but to stop and somehow come to the aid of the hard pressured centre.<ref>Lazenby p. 258</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Vic Hurley]], the Persian defeat is explained by the \"complete failure ... to field a representative army\", calling the battle the \"most convincing\" example of the fact that infantry-bowmen cannot defend any position while stationed in close-quarters and unsupported<ref>[[Vic Hurley]], ''Arrows Against Steel: The History of the Bow and how it Forever Changed Warfare'', Cerberus Books, 2011, {{ISBN|9780983475613}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=j64zo7pzt3sC&lpg=PA66&pg=PA66 p. 66]</ref> (i.e. by fortifications, or failing to support them by [[Achaemenid_Empire#Cavalry|cavalry and chariots]], as was the common Persian tactic).\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Main article|Greco-Persian Wars|Second Persian invasion of Greece}}\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the battle, Herodotus says that the Persian fleet sailed around Cape Sounion to attack Athens directly.<ref name = VI115/> As has been discussed [[#Prelude|above]], some modern historians place this attempt just before the battle.

This style had developed during internecine warfare amongst the Greeks; since each city-state fought in the same way, the advantages and disadvantages of the hoplite phalanx had not been obvious.<ref name = \"h194\">Holland, pp. 194–97</ref> Marathon was the first time a phalanx faced more lightly armed troops, and revealed how effective the hoplites could be in battle.<ref name = \"h194\"/> The phalanx formation was still vulnerable to cavalry (the cause of much caution by the Greek forces at the [[Battle of Plataea]]), but used in the right circumstances, it was now shown to be a potentially devastating weapon.<ref name = \"h344\">Holland, pp. 344–52</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n=== Legends associated with the battle ===\nThe most famous legend associated with Marathon is that of the runner [[Pheidippides]] (or Philippides) bringing news to Athens of the battle, which is described [[#Marathon run|below]].\n\n[[File:Pan satyre della Valle.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|Statue of Pan, Capitoline Museum, Rome]]\n\nPheidippides' run to Sparta to bring aid has other legends associated with it. Herodotus mentions that Pheidippides was visited by the god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] on his way to Sparta (or perhaps on his return journey).<ref name = \"h187\"/> Pan asked why the Athenians did not honor him and the awed Pheidippides promised that they would do so from then on. The god apparently felt that the promise would be kept, so he appeared in battle and at the crucial moment he instilled the Persians with his own brand of fear, the mindless, frenzied fear that bore his name: \"[[panic]]\". After the battle, a sacred precinct was established for Pan in a grotto on the north slope of the Acropolis, and a sacrifice was annually offered.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=6.105 VI, 105]</ref>\n\nSimilarly, after the victory the festival of the ''Agroteras Thysia'' (\"sacrifice to the Agrotéra\") was held at [[Agrae]] near [[Athens]], in honor of [[Artemis]] [[Agrotera]] (\"Artemis the Huntress\"). This was in fulfillment of a vow made by the city before the battle, to offer in sacrifice a number of goats equal to that of the [[Persia]]ns slain in the conflict. The number was so great, it was decided to offer 500 goats yearly until the number was filled. [[Xenophon]] notes that at his time, 90 years after the battle, goats were still offered yearly.<ref>Plutarch, ''On the Malice of Herodotus'', 26</ref><ref>Xenophon, ''Anabasis'' III, 2</ref><ref>Aelian, ''Varia Historia'' II, 25</ref><ref>Aristophanes, ''The Knights'', 660</ref>\n\nPlutarch mentions that the Athenians saw the phantom of King [[Theseus]], the mythical hero of Athens, leading the army in full battle gear in the charge against the Persians,<ref>Plutarch, ''Theseus'', 35</ref> and indeed he was depicted in the mural of the [[Stoa Poikile]] fighting for the Athenians, along with the twelve Olympian gods and other heroes.<ref>Pausanias I, 15</ref> Pausanias also tells us that: <blockquote>They say too that there chanced to be present in the battle a man of rustic appearance and dress. Having slaughtered many of the foreigners with a plough he was seen no more after the engagement. When the Athenians made enquiries at the oracle, the god merely ordered them to honor [[Echetlaeus]] (\"he of the Plough-tail\") as a hero.<ref name=\"Pausanias I, 32\"/></blockquote>\n\nAnother tale from the conflict is of the dog of Marathon. [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] relates that one hoplite brought his dog to the Athenian encampment. The dog followed his master to battle and attacked the Persians at his master's side. He also informs us that this dog is depicted in the mural of the Stoa Poikile.<ref>Aelian, ''On the Nature of Animals'' VII, 38</ref>{{clear right}}\n\n=== Marathon run ===\n{{Main article|Marathon}}\nAccording to Herodotus, an Athenian runner named [[Pheidippides]] was sent to run from Athens to Sparta to ask for assistance before the battle. He ran a distance of over 225 kilometers (140 miles), arriving in Sparta the day after he left.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=6.105 VI, 105–06]</ref> Then, following the battle, the Athenian army marched the 40 kilometers (25 miles) or so back to Athens at a very high pace (considering the quantity of armour, and the fatigue after the battle), in order to head off the Persian force sailing around Cape Sounion. They arrived back in the late afternoon, in time to see the Persian ships turn away from Athens, thus completing the Athenian victory.<ref name = \"h198\">Holland, p. 198</ref>\n\n[[File:1896 Olympic marathon.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Burton Holmes]]' photograph entitled ''\"1896: Three athletes in training for the marathon at the Olympic Games in Athens\"''.]]\nLater, in popular imagination, these two events became confused with each other, leading to a legendary but inaccurate version of events. This myth has Pheidippides running from Marathon to Athens after the battle, to announce the Greek victory with the word \"nenikēkamen!\" ([[Ancient Greek|Attic]]: {{lang|grc|νενικήκαμεν}}; we've won!), whereupon he promptly died of exhaustion. Most accounts incorrectly attribute this story to Herodotus{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}; actually, the story first appears in [[Plutarch]]'s ''On the Glory of Athens'' in the 1st century AD, who quotes from [[Heraclides Ponticus|Heracleides of Pontus]]'s lost work, giving the runner's name as either Thersipus of Erchius or Eucles.<ref>Plutarch, ''Moralia'', 347C</ref> [[Lucian of Samosata]] (2nd century AD) gives the same story but names the runner Philippides (not Pheidippides).<ref>Lucian, III</ref> It should be noted that in some medieval codices of Herodotus the name of the runner between Athens and Sparta before the battle is given as Philippides, and this name is also preferred in a few modern editions.<ref>Lazenby, p. 52</ref>\n\nWhen the idea of a modern [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] became a reality at the end of the 19th century, the initiators and organizers were looking for a great popularizing event, recalling the ancient glory of Greece.<ref name = AIMS/> The idea of organizing a \"marathon race\" came from [[Michel Bréal]], who wanted the event to feature in the [[1896 Summer Olympics|first modern Olympic Games]] in 1896 in Athens. This idea was heavily supported by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], the founder of the modern Olympics, as well as the Greeks.<ref name = \"AIMS\">{{cite web|url=http://aimsworldrunning.org/marathon_history.htm|title=Marathon History|accessdate=2008-10-15|author=AIMS}}</ref> This would echo the legendary version of events, with the competitors running from Marathon to Athens. So popular was this event that it quickly caught on, becoming a fixture at the Olympic games, with major cities staging their own annual events.<ref name = AIMS/> The distance eventually became fixed at 26 miles 385 yards, or 42.195&nbsp;km, though for the first years it was variable, being around {{convert|25|mi|km}}—the approximate distance from Marathon to Athens.<ref name = \"AIMS\"/>\n<!---This section needs to be added to, or removed.\n== Later depictions ==\nThe Battle of Marathon was briefly depicted in the opening scenes of the movie ''[[300: Rise of an Empire]]'' (2014).\n--->\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wikipedia books|First Persian invasion of Greece}}\n* [[Ancient Greek warfare]]\n* [[Timeline of ancient Greece]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Ancient sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* [[Herodotus]],  ''The Histories''\n* [[Thucydides]], ''History of The Peloponnesian Wars''\n* [[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Library''\n* [[Lysias]], ''Funeral Oration''\n* [[Plato]], ''Menexenus''\n* [[Xenophon]] ''Anabasis''\n* [[Aristotle]], ''The Athenian Constitution''\n* [[Aristophanes]], ''The Knights''\n* [[Cornelius Nepos]] ''Lives of the Eminent Commanders'' (''Miltiades'')\n* [[Plutarch]] ''Parallel Lives'' (''Aristides'', ''Themistocles'', ''Theseus''), ''On the Malice of Herodotus''\n* [[Lucian]], ''Mistakes in Greeting''\n* [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece''\n* [[Claudius Aelianus]] ''Various history'' & ''On the Nature of Animals''\n* [[Junianus Justinus|Marcus Junianus Justinus]] ''Epitome of the Phillipic History of [[Pompeius Trogus]]''\n* [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]], ''Bibliotheca or Myriobiblon'': Epitome of ''Persica'' by [[Ctesias]]\n* [[Suda]] Dictionary\n{{refend}}\n\n=== Modern studies ===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* Hans W.

I'll give a few examples - Miltiades shouted \"Rush at them\", not \"At them\". Secondly it is entirely plausible and highly likely that the Greeks ran straight at the Persian lines. Firstly it was necessary so that the Persians couldn't muster their cavalry which would have decimated the Greeks. Secondly they weren't sprinting - it would have been more of a jog and still have taken them ~10 minutes to run what was roughly a mile. Thirdly the weight of hoplite armour has been greatly exagerrated and recent scholarship reflects this; full armour (which few hopolites would have had as they had to supply their own) would only be ~55-70% of previous estimated. Fourthly Greeks of this time were mostly farmers who were used to long, hard physical labour and thus would be in an excellent physical condition - much stronger and fitter than almost all modern men. Fifthly, the order of battle maps are horribly wrong; the Persians assembled in battle line in front of their camp which did not face the sea there and if it did, where were the horses? Why couldn't they have mustered them? That \"marsche\" was at that time probably sea and the Persian camp was near there, with the horses located beyond it in the hills.\n\n==GIFs==\nI've added two GIFs depicting the battle of Marathon [[User:Assyrio|ܐܵܬܘܿܪܵܝܵܐ]] 16:21, 2 October 2010 (UTC)\n\n==Archive==\n----\nThe text of this article states, \"Darius learned through Hippias that the Alcemaeonidae, a powerful Athenian family, were opposed to Miltiades and \nready to help reinstate Hippias.\"\n\nThis sounds doubtful.  The Alcmaeonidae included some of the leading supporters for the democracy, didn't they?  In that case they would hardly have wanted to reinstate Hippias, and Miltiades was never really in charge of anything. <- Miltiades was given command of the battle; I'd say that is fairly substantial.\n\nThe text also states, \"Hippias, tyrant of Athens, had been expelled in 510 BC by his people, with the assistance of Cleomenes, King of Sparta. He fled to the court of Darius to seek assistance.\"  The link for Hippias goes to Hippias of Elis, a Sophist. The article there gives no hint that Hippias of Elis was also the \n\"tyrant of Athens.\"  I presume that these were two different people, so the\nlink is incorrect.  If they were in fact the same person, then the article about Hippias of Elis should be updated.\n\n:Well, the Hippias problem is fixed...as for the rest, Hippias may have been lying to Darius to convince him to invade, but I don't really know that particular aspect of the story. [[User:Adam Bishop|Adam Bishop]] 04:17, 29 Oct 2003 (UTC)\n----\n07/19/2004---\nNews out now that the battle date is possibly off by 1 month. The source I read put the date at August 12, explaining why the runner died after running the distance--heat stroke.\n: [http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/mystery_marathon_0407191.html Link for that.] It talks about it being a month earlier than the current Sept. 12 thinking, but I think that would be a lunar month, rather than a 30 or 31 day month. So it would probably be more like Aug. 13 to 15 or so.-- [[User:JohnOwens|John Owens]] [[User talk:JohnOwens|(talk)]] 19:10, 2004 Jul 19 (UTC)\n\nThat info about the moon and the Spartan calendar is interesting, but I wouldn't want to change the date based on the Phidippides story, which may never have happened anyway...I think there should be some corroborating sources as well, this sounds like the sort of thing that might have been published in a journal somewhere. [[User:Adam Bishop|Adam Bishop]] 03:25, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)\n\n----\nThis was recently added:\n\n:\"According to a new interpretation of the legend, Philippides was retreating from the battlefield of Marathon after the Persians gained the upper hand. According to the Dipakavani (an ancient commentary recently found in the Deccan Plateau of India), Philippides was being chased by a battalion on horseback, and could cover the said distance only because of his tremendous skill as a runner, presumably honed while on job as a professional messenger. The original legend concerning the message to be delivered seems to be a corruption entertained by Herodotus as a result of the known resume of Philippides, who was famed as a Olympian runner.\"\n\nThrough Google, at least, there is no evidence for this; Dipakavani does not show up at all. If this has been published anywhere, then we can put it back. [[User:Adam Bishop|Adam Bishop]] 16:09, 14 Aug 2004 (UTC)\n\n----\nThe number of Persian soldiers is exaggerated. They were no more than 20,000, more probably 15,000. These numbers can be derived by the fact that the Greeks, in order to have a front line equal to the Persian one, were compelled to deploy the central tribes on 4 ranks, instead than on 8, as usual: counting the Platea contingent, the Greek army had a front line of about 1,500 m. We can therefore assume the same length for the Persian army. The latter was formed by the 'artisbara' in the middle, the opilites (about 4,000) and the other Persian troops (about 5,000) on the wings, and the Scitian archers (2,000) in front of the 'artisbara'. Subtracting the front of the winger troops from the total (about 450 m) the result is the length of the 'artisbara' formation: about 1,000 m. Even adopting two ranks for the 'artisbara', they could be no more than 10,000 men, that is a 'baivarabam'. The total amount is therefore about 20,000 men. --[[User:Panairjdde|Panairjdde]] 17:02, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)\n\n:Well presumably the 26 000 comes from adding up the numbers in Herodotus. If so, that's a surprisingly accurate guess, if your estimate is 20 000 - usually Herodotus would have a wildly exaggerated number.

For eight days the armies peacefully confronted each other.''\n\nWhat did the Persians intend to do? AFAIK they wanted to march to Athens, but the Greek Army blocked the way in a position that was hard to attack. It should clarified why the persians didn't move.  [[User:Nevfennas|Nevfennas]]\n\n== Casualty Rates ==\nI find the whole concept of one sided casualty rates such as the Battle of Marathon given as fact a bit too much to beleive.\nFor two armies adding to 30,000 men coming into contact assuming that at least 10% of the men actually engaged each other in hand to hand combat to state such a a low death rate for the Greeks seems more fiction than fact. 3000 men attacking each other at close range would generate more casualty than 300 men on either side.\n\nI also know that the Battle of Marathon derives majority of its facts from the winning side and is part of our folk lore.\n\nAs a military history fan I tend to try and recreate battles in my mind to see if they pass the basic math and real life situations.  <small>&mdash;''The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by'' [[User:63.97.37.197|63.97.37.197]] ([[User talk:63.97.37.197|talk]]&nbsp;•&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/63.97.37.197|contribs]]) 22:30, January 4, 2006.</small><!--Inserted with Template:Unsigned-->\n\nI agree, the fact that only 192 died for greece compared to 6400 persians seems very hard to swallow this would mean every one Greek killed more than thirty persians.

The Greek Hoplites were far better armoured and had longer weapons. Especially the persian archers were probably ill-suited for close-combat with a Hoplite, so once the Greek managed to get to them after breaking through the Persian Infantry, it was probably a one-sided battle. [[User:Nevfennas|Nevfennas]] 10:11, 15 January 2006 (UTC)\n\nWell, as the article suggests, there was enough hand-to-hand combat in the center for the Greeks to retreat.  Surely it had to do with casualties.  Troops do not retreat from success.  Also I played the part of the Greeks charging 200 yards in full armor.  Admittedly I am out of shape, but running 200 yards with full battle gear as the article suggests, against a foe that is primarily made of archers (assuming 2 volleys fired; again I would argue perhaps more volleys were fired, assume half of the troops could fire, that makes it 20,000 arrows in the air...), and battling long enough for the middle to collapse and it causing and inadvertent double envelope seems more Hollywood than fact.  Either fewer troops fought on that day and the victor, as you suggested, embellished the numbers, or similar to most battles of antiquities, casualty rates were very low due to lack of lethality of weapons and combat tactics.  I state these points since the title of the article misleads the reader into thinking that Herodotus' account is factual.  It jumps between fact and recount according to Herodotus.  I would suggest the title should be \"Battle According to Herodotus\" unless there are other independent works that tell of the battle factually.  <small>&mdash;''The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by'' [[User:63.97.37.251|63.97.37.251]] ([[User talk:63.97.37.251|talk]]&nbsp;•&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/63.97.37.251|contribs]]) 04:32, January 24, 2006.</small><!--Inserted with Template:Unsigned-->\n\nAnother factor could be that the Greeks held the field at the end of the day- they would have killed any Persian wounded, whereas Greek casualties would have been cared for.

Also, this site is not intended to show patriotism, in this case Greek patriotism. Thank you.\n\nHerodotus does not give numbers for the Persians as erroneously stated in the warbox. He only says it was \"a large and well-equipped land-army\" (book VI p. 94), see for example the english Herodotus translation at http://www.bostonleadershipbuilders.com/herodotus/book06.htm. As for the 50,000-60,000 number see http://www.army.gr/n/g/archive/history/marathon/index.shtml among others [[User:Ikokki|Ikokki]] 08:07, 2 May 2006 (UTC)\n\nI am not advocating a Liakopoulos-style claim that Greeks are inherently superior from all others because they are descendants of extraterrestials or gods (take your pick) and thus it is most reasonable that due to their racial superiority they beat up the barbarians despite huge numerical disadvantage. The only advantage that the Greeks had over their enemies was superior armament, superior physical ability and superior tactic. If anything the battle of Gaza in 201 BC showed that there was no racial superiority. I have added a few links to back up these numbers, probably I will add a couple more before I sleep tonight.\nAnyway the small numbers seem ridiculus. They originate from a time (late 19th- early 20th century), the height of modern imperialism when feelings of superiority of the industrial powers over other cultures lead to excesses. If 20,000 were the expeditionarry force and half of it landed in Eretria and half at Marathon (as originally said in the article) then the 10,000 lightly armed and probably un-athletic archers were an opportunity to attack to get loot for the hoplites, not a threat of the type that would lead half the generals to insist that the best course of action was to get locked up behind the wall. The landing force was most likely larger than the army Athenians and allies could hope to raise. Since there were 34,000 rowers at Salamis and 8,000 hoplites at Plataea, the military potential of Athens (every man between 18-55) was probably over 40,000 in 490 BC. This seems as a minimum rather than a maximum.\n[[User:Ikokki|Ikokki]] 19:48, 2 May 2006 (UTC)\n\n:Some believe that the reason the battle occured after the long stalemate was that the Persians had decided to retreat to their ships. This seems believable, as they had to assume that Spartas troops would be arriving soon, so continuing the stalemate would not bring them any benefit (of course this could also explain a persian decision to finally attack the Greeks). If the persians were in the process of embarking and the Greek decided to exploit that with an attack they would have waited until a good part of the persians were already on the ships. This would have eliminated any threat from the persian cavalry, as embarking the horses was a more complex process than embarking the troops and would have been done first. By this way the persians could well have a 6 to 1 superiority in the overall numbers, but far less troops actually able to fight on the battlefield. Add to that the better equipment of the Hoplites and the confusions arising from the unusal fast charge of the Greek and you can easily imagine that the persian troops still on land lost their order during the onslaught. And once the persians were in a rout or pushed into the sea the casualty rate 32:1 starts getting quite believable, cause most of these were not killed fighting the Greek, but killed/drowned trying to run from them.[[User:Nevfennas|Nevfennas]] 21:05, 2 May 2006 (UTC)\n\n----\nInteresting, so you give me one source other than the proven exaggerated claims of Herodotus, and that is a Greek site, written Greek. Take into consideration that though 20 000 seems like too little for a 600 ship originally expedition, half of the force was wiped out by sea. There may have been anywhere from 40,000-50,000 originally on the Persian forces, but after the storm and by the time they reached the number was indedd closer to 20,000-26000. \n\nHere are some non Greek, non Persian sites, for now they outnumber your's care to show any more sources with such high numbers that are also please not Greek, and show its blind patriotism with a Greek flag on the front. \n\nThese sites below all back my stats and arguments.\nhttp://ancienthistory.about.com/od/persianwararticles/a/MarathonBattle.htm\nhttp://www.livius.org/man-md/marathon/marathon.html\nhttp://mo.essortment.com/thebattleofma_rwnl.htm\nhttp://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/marathon.htm\nhttp://www.historylink102.com/greece3/battle-marathon.htm\n\nAlso if you ever wish to know a more accurrate stat on persian forces when ever they faced the Greeks, take the Herodotus claimed number and divide it by 10, this usually gives one a far more accurrate reading.\n\n:''half of the force was wiped out by sea'' what exactly are you referring to? I can't find these losses in the article unless you mean the ships lost in the storm at Cape Athos. But that was an operation 2 years earlier. The persian army at marathon had not yet suffered major losses, save a possible detached force laying siege to Eretria. [[User:Nevfennas|Nevfennas]] 19:39, 3 May 2006 (UTC)\n\nNone of the sites you mention how they calculated the numbers. On the other hand I've already put two ways in the text that calculate the big numbers. I'll give you a third: If the Persians had a 2,000-front and fought in thirty ranks as Xenophon mentions in \"Cyrus's education\" here are 60,000. If and when you change back the number on the warbox GIVE ALSO IN THE TEXT WHY THE NUMBER WAS LOW. Do not create contradicitons between the warbox and the text.\nWhen was the storm you mention? Neither Herodotus nor any historian mentions any storm in Darius's second campaign. While there were losses in Eretria, they were not really significant since there was no real battle.\nI've heard the Herodotus 10 rule. It dates from the time when there was much less respect for his work than now. So, the Persians came with 60 ships? Naxos, Eretria and Athens and Sparta could match that in 490 BC. Were there 170,000 infantry and 8,000 cavalry in Thermopylae? The Alliance of Corinth plus Thessaly, Argos, Thebes, Crete and the northern Greek states could match that, why not face the Persian Army in the open plain of the Strymon valley, the limit of the greek world back then? Was the Persian fleet 121 ships? Athens alone had more. Does Herodotus exxagerate? Yes he does. But not THAT much, he was a historian, not a <i> logographos </i>.\n\n----\nI think I now see you problem, we have confused the first expedition and second expedition to Greece. This really large force you are talking about that took on Sparta and Corinth came later on Xerxes, when the grand invasion began in 480 BCE. Marathon occurred shortly after the breaking of the rebellions in Ionia because Darius felt the revolts would never be put down until mainland greece was finished first. On the Persian's first expedition Darius severly underestimated the Greeks taking not many forces. When he gets pushed back, Xerxes plans the second invasion that came ten years after 490 BCE one. Xerxes was present on the first expedition so he decided that to next time take a much larger force. I think you have mistkaed Darius' and Xerxes' expeditions haven't you? By the way, I don't mind the current 20,000-60,000 range, to me that is a good one.\n\nFurthermore, you have shown only Herodotus accounts (known bias and exaggeration) and a patriotic Greek site. If you can find 4-5 other sources that have the same stats then we will have a tie. Also the 10 policy is only meant for stats on the 1st expedition not the second. On the second involving Xerxes, Herodotus just starts pullimg numbers out of his ass like plataea, there is no longer a constant formula he usues to calculate strength and casualties. Like, consider 159 casualties for Greeks at Plataea, I'm sorry thats just bull, it seems to be Greek writers on their own history especially regarding wars are not reliable. Romans do a better job usually, hence Plutarch's number of 1360 casualties at plataea.\n\nAlso the war box and article was uniform, until you came along and made several bias changes, several admins had come to a consensus. Don't accuse me, everything was fine and agreed upon before.\n\n-----\nThere were three Persian invasions in Greece, in 492 BC by Mardonius which ended after a storm off Cape Athos, the second in 490 BC by Datis and Artafernes which ended in Marathon and the third by Xerxes in 480 BC that ended in Plataea. I did not change the numbers mister anonymous without references, which the original article did not have. There is no reason mr anonymous why modern greek writers should be biased on their history, no moral gain comes from claiming to defeat larger forces than they did. Plutarch BTW was Greek, from Kynos Kefales in Boeotia, he only lived in the Grecoroman era (30 BC - 330 AD). His biographies are in 8th grade ancient greek literature courses. Herodotus is biased in favor of his patrons Athens and Sparta, he is not Thucydides, but unlike logographers for example Ecateus he travelled in the Greek world and the Persian empire,as far as Egypt in order to gain information for his book. He was not a thorough checker of his sources but wrote down the numbers he heard from his hosts, he did not make them up out of the blue, mr anonymous. And if you have anything to add in the text why the numbers were small, add them. This is what wikipedia is supossed to be about mr anonymous[[User:Ikokki|Ikokki]] 23:21, 4 May 2006 (UTC)\n\n----\nHey bud,\nWhy did the tone get so bad all of a sudden, I would like to add I have no grudges against you right now. Thanks for the correction on Plutarch though. The first operation in 492BCE you were talking about wasn't that not so much the goal to capture Greece but darius' desire to have a foothold in Europe by capturing Macedonia and Thrace. I did not realize capturing Greece was a priority in that mission, I just thought it was to quell rebellions in Ionia and capture Thrace and Macedonia. \nThe current stats in the article I prefer, for you have kindly put both, the sources for 20,000-26,000 with the sources I gave you and the ones you preferred, which I have no objection to, as long as there is both sides of the stories, something with such varying numbers should have both sets of numbers. I also appreciate you inserted those sources and the numbers 20,000 into the article, I was a little hesitant for I am still a little computer iliterate, and feared I would screw up the formatting of the page. I currently like the current state of numbers. We have a wider range of numbers for the Persian numbers with sources backing the lower end and higher end. This way the readers and users have both sets and can make their own interpretations and perspectives and hey, thats all that history is right: interpretations of past ideas, facts and events. I hope I have not behaved rudely, I hope my former comments were not too crude, I was just trying to state my point.\n\nAlso Ikokki, 3 out of 4 of these sources you gave advocating the higher end numbers are in Greek (the numbered ones in the article), it would be more useful if the sources were in English, then a higher percentage of the people can see and believe the numbers, don't you think. Also, why would contemporary greeks show patriotism by bloating numbers strength and casualties, perhaps modern greeks would not, but there is without doubt that ancient ones will, we continue to have modern estimates by historians usually lower than the earlier souces, hence Marathon, Thermopylae, and Plataea. And let's not even get into the tales of the idiot Arrian and Curtius. And unforunately too many of the numbers we have today are either closely related to or simply are the same ancient sources that are without a doubt, bias and exaggerated.\n----\n\nMardonius's campaign in 492 BC probably did not have the intention of conquering Athens and Eretria but since he crossed the borders of the Hellenic Republic it is written in our history books as the first invasion. I am very well aware that most of the links I added are not english as the two more references I will add, but this is because there are few sources in English who claim large numbers. This probably is because the consensus that formed 100 years ago in Oxbridge and spread to the rest of the Anglo-Saxon world was that the numbers were small.\nThe change of tone came when I thout I read that by adding referenced data I screwed up. Now if we can add up more references I think we can get featured article status. About Curtius I don't know since we didn't do Latin in school (except those going for literature). As for Arrian, the first Greek governor of a Roman province, I disagree but this is not the appropriate page.

The common view, that the Persians were fighting with their backs to the sea, is known to be controversial and seems odd in several respects. If the Persians were responsible for beginning the battle, why would they choose such an unfavorable position? It also leaves their left flank completely exposed to the Greeks approaching from the west. Herodotus also never mentions that they were boarding the ships at the time, which would possibly explain it. The Osprey publication on the battle (Marathon 490 BC) offers what I think is a better explanation, namely that a perpendicular orientation with the Persians' left flank anchored on the shoreline makes much better sense from a tactical perspective. I'm not talking a major revision of the article, just a mention that there are other possibilities.\n\n:The article mentions the boarding the ships hypothesis without adopting it. A new disposition section would be good if it is properly cited, though generally a section takes more than one paragraph.

The attributive participle προμαχούντες implies not only those fighters out in front, or vanguard, but also those who provide protection for others, and in that sense, champions. The aorist εστόρεσαν means strew or spread, or perhaps here, scatter.

Even if they do, do we need to repeat their claims without question?\n\nIt's certainly interesting and relevant that there were fairly modern Greek folktales about the battle, and I'm glad they were included here, but I really don't think they should be presented as evidence for any of the stories; it should suffice to say they existed. &mdash;[[User:Mirv|Charles P._]]<small>[[User talk:Mirv|(Mirv)]]</small> 05:44, 8 November 2006 (UTC)\n\n:Kakrides compiled a book about how the ancient Greeks were seen in later legend. In his book he includes a longer version of this passage. In the E Istorika dedicated to the battle of Marathon, the last article (about 4 pages long with pictures) is about the Marathon run where, after a rather long discussion with references over whether there was a runner and which route he took this legend is given as further evidence (it is called weak evidence though) that the runner existed. Treat it like the other tales mentioned by Kakrides, like that from Aetoloacarnania that the ancient Greeks were 6 meter tall.

I'm specifically going over all of the \"Conflicts, battles and military exercises\" articles. I believe the article currently meets the majority of the criteria and should remain listed as a [[WP:GA|Good article]]. In reviewing the article, I have found there are some issues that may need to be addressed, and I'll leave the article on hold for seven days for them to be fixed.\nAdd inline citations for:\n#\"However, he was born a few years after the battle, and it is believed he wrote his book after the Peace of Callias (449 BC/448 BC).\"\n#\"In order for the Athenians to revolt, two things would need to happen: the populace would need to be encouraged to revolt, and the Athenian army would have to leave Athens so that they could not crush it.\"\n#\"Some of the poor who remembered Peisistratus well, since he had given them jobs, probably hoped for a victory of the Persians and a change in regime to give them more power, which is one of the reasons Hippias ordered the landing in Marathon where the vast majority of local inhabitants were from these social classes.\"\n#Some claim that Artaphernes took part of the Persian army and laid siege to Eretria, while the remainder of the army crossed with Datis and landed in the Bay of Marathon.\n#Others claim that the events happened consecutively: at first Eretria was besieged and fell, and later the whole army landed at Schinias beach.\n#\"It states: \"The cavalry left. When Datis surrendered and was ready for retreat, the Ionians climbed the trees and gave the Athenians the signal that the cavalry had left. And when Miltiades realized that, he attacked and thus won. From there comes the above-mentioned quote, which is used when someone breaks ranks before battle\".\"\n#\"Proponents of the former opinion note the following arguments: the ancient Greeks—as indicated by the surviving statues—were in very good physical condition (the hoplite run had recently become an Olympic sport), and if they had run the entire distance, it would have been covered in about 5 minutes, whereas if they had marched, it would have probably taken 10, enough time for the Persians to react, which they did not.\"\n#\"Some modern historians doubt they traveled so fast.\"\n#\"The tomb was excavated in the 1880s by German archeologists.\"\n#\"See D.W.

Gen.]] [[George Meade]]'s [[Army of the Potomac]] defeated attacks by Confederate [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia]], halting Lee's invasion of the North.\n\nAfter his success at [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]] in [[Virginia]] in May 1863, Lee led his army through the [[Shenandoah Valley]] to begin his second invasion of the North—the [[Gettysburg Campaign]]. With his army in high spirits, Lee intended to shift the focus of the summer campaign from war-ravaged northern Virginia and hoped to influence Northern politicians to give up their prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]], or even [[Philadelphia]]. Prodded by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]], Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]] moved his army in pursuit, but was relieved of command just three days before the battle and replaced by Meade.\n\nElements of the two armies initially collided at Gettysburg on July 1, 1863, as Lee urgently concentrated his forces there, his objective being to engage the Union army and destroy it. Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brig. Gen. [[John Buford]], and soon reinforced with two [[corps]] of Union [[infantry]]. However, two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north, collapsing the hastily developed Union lines, sending the defenders retreating through the streets of the town to the hills just to the south.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | title = Battle of Gettysburg | url = https://www.britannica.com/event/Battle-of-Gettysburg| access-date =3 July 2012 | date = 15 February 2017 | publisher = [[Britannica.com]]}}</ref>\n\nOn the second day of battle, most of both armies had assembled. The Union line was laid out in a defensive formation resembling a fishhook. In the late afternoon of July 2, Lee launched a heavy assault on the Union left flank, and fierce fighting raged at [[Little Round Top]], the [[Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day#Wheatfield|Wheatfield]], [[Devil's Den]], and the [[Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day#Peach Orchard|Peach Orchard]]. On the Union right, Confederate [[demonstration (military)|demonstrations]] escalated into full-scale assaults on [[Culp's Hill]] and [[Cemetery Hill]].

Lee decided upon a second invasion of the North (the first was the unsuccessful [[Maryland Campaign]] of September 1862, which ended in the bloody [[Battle of Antietam]]). Such a move would upset [[Union (American Civil War)|U.S.]] plans for the summer campaigning season and possibly reduce the pressure on the besieged Confederate garrison at [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]]. The invasion would allow the Confederates to live off the bounty of the rich Northern farms while giving war-ravaged [[Virginia]] a much-needed rest. In addition, Lee's 72,000-man army<ref name=BM260/> could threaten Philadelphia, [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], and possibly strengthen the growing peace movement in the North.<ref>Coddington, pp. 8–9; Eicher, p. 490.</ref>\n\n===Initial movements to battle===\nThus, on June 3, Lee's army began to shift northward from [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]]. Following the death of [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson]], Lee reorganized his two large corps into three new corps, commanded by [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]] [[James Longstreet]] (First Corps), Lt. Gen. [[Richard S. Ewell]] (Second), and Lt. Gen. [[A.P. Hill]] (Third); both Ewell and Hill, who had formerly reported to Jackson as division commanders, were new to this level of responsibility. The Cavalry Division remained under the command of Maj. Gen. [[J.E.B. Stuart]].<ref>Eicher, pp. 489–91.</ref>\n\nThe Union Army of the Potomac, under Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]], consisted of seven infantry corps, a cavalry corps, and an Artillery Reserve, for a combined strength of more than 100,000 men.<ref name=BM125/>\n\nThe first major action of the campaign took place on June 9 between cavalry forces at [[Battle of Brandy Station|Brandy Station]], near [[Culpeper, Virginia]]. The 9,500 Confederate cavalrymen under Stuart were surprised by Maj. Gen. [[Alfred Pleasonton]]'s [[combined arms]] force of two cavalry divisions (8,000 troopers) and 3,000 infantry, but Stuart eventually repulsed the Union attack. The inconclusive battle, the largest predominantly cavalry engagement of the war, proved for the first time that the Union horse soldier was equal to his Southern counterpart.<ref>Symonds, p. 36.</ref>\n\nBy mid-June, the Army of Northern Virginia was poised to cross the Potomac River and enter [[Maryland]]. After defeating the U.S. garrisons at [[Second Battle of Winchester|Winchester]] and [[Martinsburg, West Virginia|Martinsburg]], Ewell's Second Corps began crossing the river on June 15. Hill's and Longstreet's corps followed on June 24 and 25. Hooker's army pursued, keeping between the U.S. capital and Lee's army. The U.S. crossed the Potomac from June 25 to 27.<ref>Trudeau, pp. 45, 66.</ref>\n\nLee gave strict orders for his army to minimize any negative impacts on the civilian population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YmsFAAAAQAAJ&printsec=titlepage#PRA1-PA323,M1|title=The Rebellion Record: A Diary of American Events, with Documents, Narratives Illustrative Incidents, Poetry, Etc|first=Frank|last=Moore|date=September 25, 1864|publisher=Putnam|via=Google Books}}</ref> Food, horses, and other supplies were generally not seized outright, although quartermasters reimbursing Northern farmers and merchants with [[Confederate States of America dollar|Confederate money]] were not well received. Various towns, most notably [[York, Pennsylvania]], were required to pay indemnities in lieu of supplies, under threat of destruction. During the invasion, the Confederates seized some 40 northern [[African Americans]]. A few of them were escaped fugitive [[History of slavery in the United States|slaves]], but most were freemen; all were sent south into slavery under guard.<ref name=\"Symonds, pp. 49–54\"/><ref name=JWLoewenP350/><ref name=BDSimpson072015/>\n\nOn June 26, elements of Maj. Gen. [[Jubal Early]]'s division of Ewell's Corps occupied the town of Gettysburg after chasing off newly raised Pennsylvania [[militia]] in a series of minor skirmishes. Early laid the borough under tribute but did not collect any significant supplies. Soldiers burned several railroad cars and a [[covered bridge]], and destroyed nearby rails and [[telegraph]] lines. The following morning, Early departed for adjacent [[York County, Pennsylvania|York County]].<ref>Nye, pp. 272–78.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, in a controversial move, Lee allowed J.E.B. Stuart to take a portion of the army's cavalry and ride around the east flank of the Union army. Lee's orders gave Stuart much latitude, and both generals share the blame for the long absence of Stuart's cavalry, as well as for the failure to assign a more active role to the cavalry left with the army. Stuart and his three best brigades were absent from the army during the crucial phase of the approach to Gettysburg and the first two days of battle. By June 29, Lee's army was strung out in an arc from [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania|Chambersburg]] ({{convert|28|mi|km}} northwest of Gettysburg) to [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania|Carlisle]] ({{convert|30|mi|km}} north of Gettysburg) to near [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] and [[Wrightsville, Pennsylvania|Wrightsville]] on the [[Susquehanna River]].<ref>Symonds, pp. 41–43; Sears, pp. 103–106; Esposito, text for Map 94 ([https://archive.fo/20100607100747/http://www.military.com/Resources/ResourceFileView/civilwar_maps_map34_largerview.htm Map 34b] in the online version); Eicher, pp. 504–507; McPherson, p. 649.</ref>\n\nIn a dispute over the use of the forces defending the [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]] garrison, Hooker offered his resignation, and [[Abraham Lincoln]] and General-in-Chief [[Henry W. Halleck]], who were looking for an excuse to get rid of him, immediately accepted. They replaced Hooker early on the morning of June 28 with Maj. Gen. George Gordon Meade, then commander of the [[V Corps (Union Army)|V Corps]].<ref>Sears, p. 123; Trudeau, p. 128.</ref>\n\nOn June 29, when Lee learned that the Army of the Potomac had crossed the Potomac River, he ordered a concentration of his forces around [[Cashtown-McKnightstown, Pennsylvania|Cashtown]], located at the eastern base of [[South Mountain (Maryland and Pennsylvania)|South Mountain]] and {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} west of Gettysburg.<ref>Coddington, pp. 181, 189.</ref> On June 30, while part of Hill's Corps was in Cashtown, one of Hill's brigades, North Carolinians under [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brig. Gen.]] [[J. Johnston Pettigrew]], ventured toward Gettysburg. In his memoirs, Maj. Gen. [[Henry Heth]], Pettigrew's division commander, claimed that he sent Pettigrew to search for supplies in town—especially shoes.<ref>Eicher, pp. 508–509, discounts Heth's claim because the previous visit by Early to Gettysburg would have made the lack of shoe factories or stores obvious. However, many mainstream historians accept Heth's account: Sears, p. 136; Foote, p. 465; Clark, p. 35; Tucker, pp. 97–98; Martin, p. 25; Pfanz, ''First Day'', p. 25.</ref>\n\nWhen Pettigrew's troops approached Gettysburg on June 30, they noticed Union cavalry under Brig. Gen. [[John Buford]] arriving south of town, and Pettigrew returned to Cashtown without engaging them. When Pettigrew told Hill and Heth what he had seen, neither general believed that there was a substantial U.S. force in or near the town, suspecting that it had been only Pennsylvania militia. Despite General Lee's order to avoid a general engagement until his entire army was concentrated, Hill decided to mount a significant [[Reconnaissance-in-force|reconnaissance in force]] the following morning to determine the size and strength of the enemy force in his front. Around 5 a.m. on Wednesday, July 1, two brigades of Heth's division advanced to Gettysburg.<ref>Eicher, p. 508; Tucker, pp. 99–102.</ref>\n\n==Opposing forces==\n===Union===\n{| style=\"float:right;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#9cf;\"|Key commanders ('''[[Army of the Potomac]]''')\n|-\n|<gallery perrow=3>\nFile:George G.

These were appropriate terrain for a delaying action by his small cavalry division against superior Confederate infantry forces, meant to buy time awaiting the arrival of Union infantrymen who could occupy the strong defensive positions south of town at [[Cemetery Hill]], [[Cemetery Ridge]], and [[Culp's Hill]].

[[William Gamble (USA)|William Gamble's]] cavalry brigade, who raised determined resistance and delaying tactics from behind fence posts with fire from their breechloading [[carbine]]s.<ref>Martin, pp. 80–81. The troopers carried single-shot, breechloading carbines manufactured by [[Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Company|Sharps]], Burnside, and others. It is a modern myth that they were armed with multi-shot repeating carbines. Nevertheless, they were able to fire two or three times faster than a muzzle-loaded carbine or rifle.</ref> Still, by 10:20&nbsp;a.m., the Confederates had pushed the Union cavalrymen east to McPherson Ridge, when the vanguard of the [[I Corps (Union Army)|I Corps]] (Maj. Gen. [[John F. Reynolds]]) finally arrived.<ref>Symonds, p. 71; Coddington, p. 266; Eicher, pp. 510–11.</ref>\n\nNorth of the pike, Davis gained a temporary success against Brig. Gen. [[Lysander Cutler]]'s brigade but was repulsed with heavy losses in an action around an unfinished railroad bed cut in the ridge. South of the pike, Archer's brigade assaulted through Herbst (also known as McPherson's) Woods. The U.S. [[Iron Brigade]] under Brig. Gen. [[Solomon Meredith]] enjoyed initial success against Archer, capturing several hundred men, including Archer himself.<ref>Tucker, pp. 112–17.</ref>\n\nGeneral Reynolds was shot and killed early in the fighting while directing troop and artillery placements just to the east of the woods. Shelby Foote wrote that the Union cause lost a man considered by many to be \"the best general in the army.\"<ref>Foote, p. 468</ref> Maj. Gen. [[Abner Doubleday]] assumed command. Fighting in the Chambersburg Pike area lasted until about 12:30&nbsp;p.m. It resumed around 2:30&nbsp;p.m., when Heth's entire division engaged, adding the brigades of Pettigrew and Col. [[John M. Brockenbrough]].<ref>Tucker, p. 184; Symonds, p. 74; Pfanz, ''First Day'', pp. 269–75.</ref>\n\nAs Pettigrew's North Carolina Brigade came on line, they flanked the 19th Indiana and drove the Iron Brigade back. The 26th North Carolina (the largest regiment in the army with 839 men) lost heavily, leaving the first day's fight with around 212 men. By the end of the three-day battle, they had about 152 men standing, the highest casualty percentage for one battle of any regiment, North or South.<ref>Busey and Martin, pp. 298, 501.</ref> Slowly the Iron Brigade was pushed out of the woods toward Seminary Ridge. Hill added Maj. Gen. [[William Dorsey Pender]]'s division to the assault, and the I Corps was driven back through the grounds of the [[Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg|Lutheran Seminary]] and Gettysburg streets.<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', pp. 275–93.</ref>\n\nAs the fighting to the west proceeded, two divisions of Ewell's Second Corps, marching west toward Cashtown in accordance with Lee's order for the army to concentrate in that vicinity, turned south on the Carlisle and Harrisburg roads toward Gettysburg, while the Union [[XI Corps (Union Army)|XI Corps]] (Maj. Gen. [[Oliver O. Howard]]) raced north on the Baltimore Pike and Taneytown Road. By early afternoon, the U.S. line ran in a semicircle west, north, and northeast of Gettysburg.<ref>Clark, p. 53.</ref>\n\nHowever, the U.S. did not have enough troops; Cutler, whose brigade was deployed north of the Chambersburg Pike, had his right flank in the air. The leftmost division of the XI Corps was unable to deploy in time to strengthen the line, so Doubleday was forced to throw in reserve brigades to salvage his line.<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', p. 158.</ref>\n\nAround 2 p.m., the Confederate Second Corps divisions of Maj. Gens. [[Robert E. Rodes]] and Jubal Early assaulted and out-flanked the Union I and XI Corps positions north and northwest of town. The Confederate brigades of Col. [[Edward A. O'Neal]] and Brig. Gen. [[Alfred Iverson, Jr.|Alfred Iverson]] suffered severe losses assaulting the I Corps division of Brig. Gen. [[John C. Robinson]] south of Oak Hill. Early's division profited from a blunder by Brig. Gen. [[Francis C. Barlow]], when he advanced his XI Corps division to Blocher's Knoll (directly north of town and now known as Barlow's Knoll); this represented a [[Salient (military)|salient]]<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', p. 230.</ref> in the corps line, susceptible to attack from multiple sides, and Early's troops overran Barlow's division, which constituted the right flank of the Union Army's position. Barlow was wounded and captured in the attack.<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', pp. 156–238.</ref>\n\nAs U.S. positions collapsed both north and west of town, Gen. Howard ordered a retreat to the high ground south of town at Cemetery Hill, where he had left the division of Brig. Gen. [[Adolph von Steinwehr]] in reserve.<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', p. 294.</ref> Maj. Gen. [[Winfield S. Hancock]] assumed command of the battlefield, sent by Meade when he heard that Reynolds had been killed. Hancock, commander of the [[II Corps (Union Army)|II Corps]] and Meade's most trusted subordinate, was ordered to take command of the field and to determine whether Gettysburg was an appropriate place for a major battle.<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', pp. 337–38; Sears, pp. 223–25.</ref> Hancock told Howard, \"I think this the strongest position by nature upon which to fight a battle that I ever saw.\" When Howard agreed, Hancock concluded the discussion: \"Very well, sir, I select this as the battle-field.\" Hancock's determination had a morale-boosting effect on the retreating Union soldiers, but he played no direct tactical role on the first day.<ref>Martin, pp. 482–88.</ref>\n\nGeneral Lee understood the defensive potential to the Union if they held this high ground. He sent orders to Ewell that Cemetery Hill be taken \"if practicable.\" Ewell, who had previously served under Stonewall Jackson, a general well known for issuing peremptory orders, determined such an assault was not practicable and, thus, did not attempt it; this decision is considered by historians to be a great missed opportunity.<ref>Pfanz, ''First Day'', p. 344; Eicher, p. 517; Sears, p. 228; Trudeau, p. 253. Both Sears and Trudeau record \"if possible.\"</ref>\n\nThe first day at Gettysburg, more significant than simply a prelude to the bloody second and third days, ranks as the 23rd biggest battle of the war by number of troops engaged. About one quarter of Meade's army (22,000 men) and one third of Lee's army (27,000) were engaged.<ref>Martin, p. 9, citing Thomas L. Livermore's ''Numbers & Losses in the Civil War in America'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1900).</ref>\n\n==Second day of battle==\n[[File:Gettysburg Day2 Plan.png|thumb|350px|[[Robert E.

Two of Longstreet's brigades were on the road: Brig. Gen. [[George Pickett]], had begun the 22 mile (35 km) march from Chambersburg, while Brig. Gen. E. M. Law had begun the march from Guilford. Both arrived late in the morning. Law completed his 28-mile (45 km) march in eleven hours.<ref>Longstreet, From Manassas to Appomattox: Memoirs of the Civil War in America, (Philadelphia:J. B.

Most of the XII Corps was on Culp's Hill; the remnants of I and XI Corps defended Cemetery Hill; II Corps covered most of the northern half of Cemetery Ridge; and III Corps was ordered to take up a position to its flank. The shape of the Union line is popularly described as a \"fishhook\" formation.\n\nThe Confederate line paralleled the Union line about a mile (1,600&nbsp;m) to the west on Seminary Ridge, ran east through the town, then curved southeast to a point opposite Culp's Hill. Thus, the Union army had interior lines, while the Confederate line was nearly {{convert|5|mi|km|sigfig=1|spell=in}} long.<ref>Clark, p. 74; Eicher, p. 521.</ref>\n\nLee's battle plan for July 2 called for a general assault of Meade's positions. On the right, Longstreet's First Corps was to position itself to attack the Union left flank, facing northeast astraddle the [[Emmitsburg]] Road, and to roll up the U.S.line. The attack sequence was to begin with Maj. Gens. [[John Bell Hood]]'s and [[Lafayette McLaws]]'s divisions, followed by Maj. Gen. [[Richard H.

Though it does not appear in either his or Lee's Official Report, Ewell claimed years later that Lee had changed the order to simultaneously attack, calling for only a \"diversion\", to be turned into a full-scale attack if a favorable opportunity presented itself.<ref>Sears, p. 255; Clark, p. 69.</ref><ref name=\"Edward Porter Alexander 1907 p. 408\">Edward Porter Alexander, Military Memoirs of a Confederate.

Though Lee personally reconnoitered his left during the morning, he did not visit Longstreet's position on the Confederate right. Even so, Lee rejected suggestions that Longstreet move beyond Meade's left and attack the Union flank, capturing the supply trains and effectively blocking Meade's escape route.<ref>Longstreet, From Manassas to Appomattox: Memoirs of the Civil War in America, (Philadelphia:J.

Gen. [[Lafayette McLaws]], advanced, they unexpectedly found Maj. Gen. [[Daniel Sickles]]'s III Corps directly in their path. Sickles had been dissatisfied with the position assigned him on the southern end of Cemetery Ridge. Seeing ground better suited for artillery positions a half mile (800&nbsp;m) to the west— centered at the Sherfy farm's Peach Orchard—he violated orders and advanced his corp to the slightly higher ground along the Emmitsburg Road, moving away from Cemetery Ridge. The new line ran from Devil's Den, northwest to the Peach Orchard, then northeast along the Emmitsburg Road to south of the Codori farm. This created an untenable salient at the Peach Orchard; Brig. Gen. [[Andrew A. Humphreys]]'s division (in position along the Emmitsburg Road) and Maj. Gen. [[David B. Birney]]'s division (to the south) were subject to attacks from two sides and were spread out over a longer front than their small corps could defend effectively.<ref>Pfanz, ''Second Day'', pp. 93–97; Eicher, pp. 523–24.</ref> The Confederate artillery was ordered to open fire at 3:00&nbsp;p.m.<ref>Longstreet, From Manassas to Appomattox: Memoirs of the Civil War in America, p. 369</ref> After failing to attend a meeting at this time of Meade's corps commanders, Meade rode to Sickle's position and demanded an explanation of the situation. Knowing a confederate attack was imminent and a retreat would be endangered, Meade refused Sickles' offer to withdraw.<ref>Eicher</ref>\n\nMeade was forced to send 20,000 reinforcements:<ref>Harman, p. 59.</ref> the entire V Corps, Brig. Gen. [[John C. Caldwell]]'s division of the II Corps, most of the XII Corps, and portions of the newly arrived VI Corps. Hood's division moved more to the east than intended, losing its alignment with the Emmitsburg Road,<ref>Harman, p. 57.</ref> attacking Devil's Den and Little Round Top. McLaws, coming in on Hood's left, drove multiple attacks into the thinly stretched III Corps in the [[Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day#Wheatfield|Wheatfield]] and overwhelmed them in Sherfy's [[Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day#Peach Orchard|Peach Orchard]]. McLaws's attack eventually reached Plum Run Valley (the \"Valley of Death\") before being beaten back by the [[Pennsylvania Reserves]] division of the V Corps, moving down from Little Round Top. The III Corps was virtually destroyed as a combat unit in this battle, and Sickles's leg was amputated after it was shattered by a cannonball. Caldwell's division was destroyed piecemeal in the Wheatfield. Anderson's division, coming from McLaws's left and starting forward around 6 p.m., reached the crest of Cemetery Ridge, but could not hold the position in the face of counterattacks from the II Corps, including an almost suicidal bayonet charge by the  [[1st Minnesota Volunteer Infantry|1st Minnesota]] regiment against a Confederate brigade, ordered in desperation by Hancock to buy time for reinforcements to arrive.<ref>Sears, pp. 312–24; Eicher, pp. 530–35; Coddington, p. 423.</ref>\n\nAs fighting raged in the Wheatfield and Devil's Den, Col. [[Strong Vincent]] of V Corps had a precarious hold on Little Round Top, an important hill at the extreme left of the Union line. His brigade of four relatively small regiments was able to resist repeated assaults by Brig. Gen. [[Evander M. Law]]'s brigade of Hood's division. Meade's chief engineer, Brig. Gen. [[Gouverneur K. Warren]], had realized the importance of this position, and dispatched Vincent's brigade, an artillery battery, and the 140th New York to occupy Little Round Top mere minutes before Hood's troops arrived. The defense of Little Round Top with a bayonet charge by the [[20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment|20th Maine]], ordered by Col. [[Joshua L. Chamberlain]] but possibly led by Lt. [[Holman S. Melcher]], was one of the most fabled episodes in the Civil War and propelled Col. Chamberlain into prominence after the war.<ref>Eicher, pp. 527–30; Clark, pp. 81–85.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.gdg.org/Research/People/Chamberlain/flash.html|title = Who saved Little Round Top?|access-date = February 21, 2016|publisher = Camp Chase Gazette|last = Morgan|first = James|quote = \"Col.

P. Hill's 55 guns, engaged in a two-hour artillery barrage at extreme range that had little effect. Finally, about six o'clock, Ewell sent orders to each of his division commanders to attack the Union lines in his front.\n\nMaj. Gen. [[Edward Johnson (general)|Edward \"Allegheny\" Johnson]]'s Division \"had not been pushed close to [Culp's Hill] in preparation for an assault, although one had been contemplated all day. It now had a full mile (1,600 m) to advance and Rock Creek had to be crossed. This could only be done at few places and involved much delay. Only three of Johnson's four brigades moved to the attack.\" <ref>Edward Porter Alexander, Military Memoirs of a Confederate. (New York: Charles Scribner & Sons, 1907), p. 409</ref> Most of the hill's defenders, the Union XII Corps, had been sent to the left to defend against Longstreet's attacks, leaving only a brigade of New Yorkers under Brig. Gen. [[George S. Greene]] behind strong, newly constructed defensive works. With reinforcements from the I and XI Corps, Greene's men held off the Confederate attackers, though giving up some of the lower earthworks on the lower part of Culp's Hill.<ref>Eicher, pp. 537–38; Sauers, p. 835; Pfanz, ''Culp's Hill'', pp. 205–34; Clark, pp. 115–16.</ref>\n\nEarly was similarly unprepared when he ordered [[Harry T. Hays]]' and [[Isaac E. Avery]]'s Brigades to attack the Union XI Corps positions on East Cemetery Hill.  Once started, fighting was fierce: Col. [[Andrew L. Harris]] of the Union 2nd Brigade, 1st Division, came under a withering attack, losing half his men. Avery was wounded early on, but the Confederates reached the crest of the hill and entered the Union breastworks, capturing one or two batteries. Seeing he was not supported on his right, Hays withdrew. His right was to be supported by [[Robert E. Rodes]]' Division, but Rodes—like Early and Johnson—had not been ordered up in preparation for the attack. He had twice as far to travel as Early; by the time he came in contact with the Union skirmish line, Early's troops had already begun to withdraw.<ref>Report of Maj. Gen. R. E. Rodes, CSA, commanding division. JUNE 3-AUGUST 1, 1863.--The Gettysburg Campaign.

The Confederates attacked, and the second fight for Culp's Hill ended around 11 a.m. Harry Pfanz judged that, after some seven hours of bitter combat, \"the Union line was intact and held more strongly than before.\"<ref>Pfanz, ''Culp's Hill'', pp. 284–352; Eicher, pp. 540–41; Coddington, pp. 465–75.</ref>\n\nLee was forced to change his plans. Longstreet would command Pickett's Virginia division of his own First Corps, plus six brigades from Hill's Corps, in an attack on the U.S. II Corps position at the right center of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge. Prior to the attack, all the artillery the Confederacy could bring to bear on the U.S. positions would bombard and weaken the enemy's line.<ref>Eicher, p. 542; Coddington, pp. 485–86.</ref>\n\nMuch has been made over the years of General Longstreet's objections to General Lee's plan. In his memoirs, Longstreet described their discussion as follows:\n\n{{quote|[Lee] rode over after sunrise and gave his orders. His plan was to assault the enemy's left centre by a column to be composed of McLaws's and Hood's divisions reinforced by Pickett's brigades. I thought that it would not do; that the point had been fully tested the day before, by more men, when all were fresh; that the enemy was there looking for us, as we heard him during the night putting up his defences; that the divisions of McLaws and Hood were holding a mile [1,600 m] along the right of my line against twenty thousand men, who would follow their withdrawal, strike the flank of the assaulting column, crush it, and get on our rear towards the Potomac River; that thirty thousand men was the minimum of force necessary for the work; that even such force would need close co-operation on other parts of the line; that the column as he proposed to organize it would have only about thirteen thousand men (the divisions having lost a third of their numbers the day before); that the column would have to march a mile [1,600 m] under concentrating battery fire, and a thousand yards [900 m] under long-range musketry; that the conditions were different from those in the days of Napoleon, when field batteries had a range of six hundred yards [550 m] and musketry about sixty yards [55 m].\n\nHe said the distance was not more than fourteen hundred yards [1280 m]. General Meade's estimate was a mile or a mile and a half [1.6 or 2.4 km] (Captain Long, the guide of the field of Gettysburg in 1888, stated that it was a trifle over a mile). He then concluded that the divisions of McLaws and Hood could remain on the defensive line; that he would reinforce by divisions of the Third Corps and Pickett's brigades, and stated the point to which the march should be directed. I asked the strength of the column. He stated fifteen thousand. Opinion was then expressed that the fifteen thousand men who could make successful assault over that field had never been arrayed for battle; but he was impatient of listening, and tired of talking, and nothing was left but to proceed.<ref>Longstreet, From Manassas to Appomattox: Memoirs of the Civil War in America, (Philadelphia:J. B. Lippincott, 1896), pp.386-387</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\n[[File:High Water Mark - Cemetery Ridge, Gettysburg Battlefield.jpg|thumb|right|The \"High Water Mark\" on Cemetery Ridge as it appears today. The monument to the 72nd Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Regiment (\"Baxter's Philadelphia Fire Zouaves\") appears at right, the Copse of Trees to the left.]]\n\n===The largest artillery bombardment of the war===\nAround 1 p.m., from 150 to 170 Confederate guns began an artillery bombardment that was probably the largest of the war. In order to save valuable ammunition for the infantry attack that they knew would follow, the Army of the Potomac's artillery, under the command of Brig. Gen. [[Henry Jackson Hunt]], at first did not return the enemy's fire. After waiting about 15 minutes, about 80 U.S. cannons added to the din. The Army of Northern Virginia was critically low on artillery ammunition, and the cannonade did not significantly affect the Union position.<ref>See discussion of varying gun estimates in [[Pickett's Charge]] article footnote.</ref>\n\n===Pickett's Charge===\nAround 3 p.m., the cannon fire subsided, and 12,500 Southern soldiers stepped from the ridgeline and advanced the three-quarters of a mile (1,200 m) to Cemetery Ridge in what is known to history as \"[[Pickett's Charge]]\". As the Confederates approached, there was fierce flanking artillery fire from Union positions on Cemetery Hill and north of Little Round Top, and musket and canister fire from Hancock's II Corps. In the Union center, the commander of artillery had held fire during the Confederate bombardment (in order to save it for the infantry assault, which Meade had correctly predicted the day before), leading Southern commanders to believe the Northern cannon batteries had been knocked out. However, they opened fire on the Confederate infantry during their approach with devastating results. Nearly one half of the attackers did not return to their own lines.\n\nAlthough the U.S. line wavered and broke temporarily at a jog called the \"Angle\" in a low stone fence, just north of a patch of vegetation called the Copse of Trees, reinforcements rushed into the breach, and the Confederate attack was repulsed. The farthest advance of Brig. Gen. [[Lewis A. Armistead]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[George Pickett]]'s division at the Angle is referred to as the \"[[High-water mark of the Confederacy]]\", arguably representing the closest the South ever came to its goal of achieving independence from the Union via military victory.<ref>McPherson, pp. 661–63; Clark, pp. 133–44; Symonds, pp. 214–41; Eicher, pp. 543–49.</ref> Union and Confederate soldiers locked in hand-to-hand combat, attacking with their rifles, bayonets, rocks and even their bare hands. Armistead ordered his Confederates to turn two captured cannons against Union troops, but discovered that there was no ammunition left, the last [[Canister shot|double canister]] shots having been used against the charging Confederates. Armistead was wounded shortly afterward three times.\n\n===Cavalry battles===\nThere were two significant cavalry engagements on July 3. Stuart was sent to guard the Confederate left flank and was to be prepared to exploit any success the infantry might achieve on Cemetery Hill by flanking the U.S. right and hitting their trains and lines of communications. {{convert|3|mi|km|sigfig=1|spell=In}} east of Gettysburg, in what is now called \"East Cavalry Field\" (not shown on the accompanying map, but between the York and Hanover Roads), Stuart's forces collided with U.S. cavalry: Brig. Gen. [[David McMurtrie Gregg]]'s division and Brig. Gen. Custer's brigade. A lengthy mounted battle, including hand-to-hand sabre combat, ensued. Custer's charge, leading the 1st Michigan Cavalry, blunted the attack by [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton's]] brigade, blocking Stuart from achieving his objectives in the U.S. rear.\n\nMeanwhile, after hearing news of the day's victory, Brig. Gen. [[Judson Kilpatrick]] launched a cavalry attack against the infantry positions of Longstreet's Corps southwest of [[Big Round Top]]. Brig. Gen. [[Elon J. Farnsworth]] protested against the futility of such a move, but obeyed orders. Farnsworth was killed in the attack, and his brigade suffered significant losses.<ref>Eicher, pp. 549–50; Longacre, pp. 226–31, 240-44; Sauers, p. 836; Wert, pp. 272–80.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Casualties===\n[[File:Battle of Gettysburg.jpg|thumb|\"The Harvest of Death\": Union dead on the battlefield at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, photographed July 5 or July 6, 1863, by [[Timothy H.

Union casualties were 23,055 (3,155 killed, 14,531 wounded, 5,369 captured or missing),<ref name=Ucasualties/> while Confederate casualties are more difficult to estimate. Many authors have referred to as many as ''28,000 Confederate casualties'',<ref>Examples of the varying Confederate casualties for July 1–3 are Sears, p. 498 (22,625); Coddington, p. 536 (20,451, \"and very likely more\"); Trudeau, p. 529 (22,874); Eicher, p. 550 (22,874, \"but probably actually totaled 28,000 or more\"); McPherson, p. 664 (28,000); Esposito, map 99 (\"near 28,000\"); Clark, p. 150 (20,448, \"but probably closer to 28,000,\" which he inaccurately cites as a nearly 40% loss); Woodworth, p. 209 (\"at least equal to Meade's and possibly as high as 28,000\"); [https://web.archive.org/web/20110513133710/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/pa002.htm NPS] (28,000)</ref> and Busey and Martin's more recent 2005 work, ''Regimental Strengths and Losses at Gettysburg'', documents 23,231 (4,708 killed, 12,693 wounded, 5,830 captured or missing).<ref name=Ccasualties/> Nearly a third of Lee's general officers were killed, wounded, or captured.<ref>Glatthaar, p. 282.</ref> The casualties for both sides during the entire campaign were 57,225.<ref>Sears, p. 513.</ref>\n\nIn addition to being the deadliest battle of the war in terms of total casualties, Gettysburg also had the highest number of Generals killed in action of any battle in the war. The Confederacy lost generals [[Paul Jones Semmes]], [[William Barksdale]], [[Richard B. Garnett|Richard Garnett]], and [[Lewis Armistead]], as well as [[J. Johnston Pettigrew]] during the retreat after the battle. The Union lost Generals [[John F. Reynolds|John Reynolds]], [[Samuel K. Zook]], [[Stephen H. Weed]], and [[Elon J. Farnsworth]], as well as [[Strong Vincent]], who after being mortally wounded was given a deathbed promotion to brigadier general. Additional senior officer casualties included the wounding of Union Generals [[Dan Sickles]] (lost a leg), [[Francis C. Barlow]], and [[Winfield Scott Hancock]]. For the Confederacy, Major General [[John Bell Hood]] lost the use of his left arm, while Major General [[Henry Heth]] received a shot to the head on the first day of battle (though incapacitated for the rest of the battle, he remarkably survived without long term injuries, credited in part due to his hat stuffed full of paper dispatches). Confederate Generals [[James Kemper]] and [[Isaac R. Trimble]] were severely wounded during Pickett's charge and captured during the Confederate retreat. General [[James J. Archer]], in command of a brigade that most likely was responsible for killing Reynolds, was taken prisoner shortly after Reynolds' death.\n\nThe following tables summarize casualties by corps for the Union and Confederate forces during the three-day battle.<ref>Busey and Martin, pp. 125–47, 260–315.

Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Lee had reformed his lines into a defensive position on Seminary Ridge the night of July 3, evacuating the town of Gettysburg. The Confederates remained on the battlefield, hoping that Meade would attack, but the cautious Union commander decided against the risk, a decision for which he would later be criticized. Both armies began to collect their remaining wounded and bury some of the dead. A proposal by Lee for a prisoner exchange was rejected by Meade.<ref>Eicher, p. 550; Coddington, pp. 539–44; Clark, pp. 146–47; Sears, p. 469; Wert, p. 300.</ref>\n\nLee started his Army of Northern Virginia in motion late the evening of July 4 towards [[Fairfield, Pennsylvania|Fairfield]] and Chambersburg. Cavalry under Brig. Gen. [[John D. Imboden]] was entrusted to escort the miles-long wagon train of supplies and wounded men that Lee wanted to take back to Virginia with him, using the route through Cashtown and Hagerstown to [[Williamsport, Maryland]]. Meade's army followed, although the pursuit was half-spirited. The recently rain-swollen Potomac trapped Lee's army on the north bank of the river for a time, but when the Union troops finally caught up, the Confederates had forded the river. The [[Battle of Williamsport|rear-guard action at Falling Waters]] on July 14 added some more names to the long casualty lists, including General Pettigrew, who was mortally wounded.<ref>Clark, pp. 147–57; Longacre, pp. 268–69.</ref>  General [[James Kemper]], severely wounded during Pickett's charge, was captured during Lee's retreat.\n\nIn a brief letter to Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck written on July 7, Lincoln remarked on the two major Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg. He continued:\n\n{{Quote|Now, if Gen. Meade can complete his work so gloriously prosecuted thus far, by the literal or substantial destruction of Lee's army, the rebellion will be over.<ref>Coddington, p. 564.</ref>}}\n\nHalleck then relayed the contents of Lincoln's letter to Meade in a telegram. Despite repeated pleas from Lincoln and Halleck, which continued over the next week, Meade did not pursue Lee's army aggressively enough to destroy it before it crossed back over the Potomac River to safety in the South. The campaign continued into Virginia with light engagements until July 23, in the minor [[Battle of Manassas Gap]], after which Meade abandoned any attempts at pursuit and the two armies took up positions across from each other on the [[Rappahannock River]].<ref>Coddington, pp. 535–74; Sears, pp. 496–97; Eicher, p. 596; Wittenberg et al., ''One Continuous Fight'', pp. 345–46..</ref>\n\n===Union reaction to the news of the victory===\nThe news of the Union victory electrified the North. A headline in ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' proclaimed \"VICTORY! [[Battle of Waterloo|WATERLOO]] ECLIPSED!\" New York diarist [[George Templeton Strong]] wrote:<ref>McPherson, p. 664.</ref>\n\n{{Quotation|The results of this victory are priceless. ... The charm of Robert E. Lee's invincibility is broken. The Army of the Potomac has at last found a general that can handle it, and has stood nobly up to its terrible work in spite of its long disheartening list of hard-fought failures. ... [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] are palsied and dumb for the moment at least. ... Government is strengthened four-fold at home and abroad.|George Templeton Strong|Diary, p. 330.}}\n\nHowever, the Union enthusiasm soon dissipated as the public realized that Lee's army had escaped destruction and the war would continue. Lincoln complained to Secretary of the Navy [[Gideon Welles]] that \"Our army held the war in the hollow of their hand and they would not close it!\"<ref>Donald, p. 446; Woodworth, p. 217.</ref> Brig. Gen. [[Alexander S. Webb]] wrote to his father on July 17, stating that such Washington politicians as \"[[Salmon P. Chase|Chase]], [[William H. Seward|Seward]] and others,\" disgusted with Meade, \"write to me that Lee really won that Battle!\"<ref>Coddington, p. 573.</ref>\n\n===Effect on the Confederacy===\nIn fact, the Confederates had lost militarily and also politically. During the final hours of the battle, Confederate Vice President [[Alexander Stephens]] was approaching the Union lines at [[Norfolk, Virginia]], under a [[White flag|flag of truce]]. Although his formal instructions from [[President of the Confederate States|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] had limited his powers to negotiate on prisoner exchanges and other procedural matters, historian [[James M. McPherson]] speculates that he had informal goals of presenting peace overtures. Davis had hoped that Stephens would reach Washington from the south while Lee's victorious army was marching toward it from the north. President Lincoln, upon hearing of the Gettysburg results, refused Stephens's request to pass through the lines. Furthermore, when the news reached London, any lingering hopes of European recognition of the Confederacy were finally abandoned. [[Henry Brooks Adams|Henry Adams]] wrote, \"The disasters of the rebels are unredeemed by even any hope of success. It is now conceded that all idea of intervention is at an end.\"<ref>McPherson, pp. 650, 664.</ref>\n\nCompounding the effects of the defeat would be end of the [[Siege of Vicksburg]], which surrendered to Grant's Federal armies in the West on July 4, the day after the Gettysburg battle.\n\nThe immediate reaction of the Southern military and public sectors was that Gettysburg was a setback, not a disaster. The sentiment was that Lee had been successful on July 1 and had fought a valiant battle on July 2–3, but could not dislodge the Union Army from the strong defensive position to which it fled. The Confederates successfully stood their ground on July 4 and withdrew only after they realized Meade would not attack them. The withdrawal to the Potomac that could have been a disaster was handled masterfully. Furthermore, the Army of the Potomac had been kept away from Virginia farmlands for the summer and all predicted that Meade would be too timid to threaten them for the rest of the year. Lee himself had a positive view of the campaign, writing to his wife that the army had returned \"rather sooner than I had originally contemplated, but having accomplished what I proposed on leaving the Rappahannock, viz., relieving the Valley of the presence of the enemy and drawing his Army north of the Potomac.\" He was quoted as saying to Maj. John Seddon, brother of the Confederate secretary of war, \"Sir, we did whip them at Gettysburg, and it will be seen for the next six months that ''that army'' will be as quiet as a sucking dove.\" Some Southern publications, such as the ''Charleston Mercury'', criticized Lee's actions in the campaign and on August 8, he offered his resignation to President Davis, who quickly rejected it.<ref>Gallagher, ''Lee and His Army'', pp. 86, 93, 102-05; Sears, pp. 501–502; McPherson, p. 665, in contrast to Gallagher, depicts Lee as \"profoundly depressed\" about the battle.</ref>\n\nGettysburg became a postbellum focus of the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|\"Lost Cause\"]], a movement by writers such as Edward A. Pollard and Jubal Early to explain the reasons for the Confederate defeat in the war. A fundamental premise of their argument was that the South was doomed because of the overwhelming advantage in manpower and industrial might possessed by the North. However, they claim it also suffered because Robert E. Lee, who up until this time had been almost invincible, was betrayed by the failures of some of his key subordinates at Gettysburg: Ewell, for failing to seize Cemetery Hill on July 1; Stuart, for depriving the army of cavalry intelligence for a key part of the campaign; and especially Longstreet, for failing to attack on July 2 as early and as forcefully as Lee had originally intended. In this view, Gettysburg was seen as a great lost opportunity, in which a decisive victory by Lee could have meant the end of the war in the Confederacy's favor.<ref>Gallagher, ''Lee and His Generals'', pp. 207–208; Sears, p. 503; Woodworth, p. 221. Gallagher's essay \"Jubal A. Early, The Lost Cause, and Civil War History: A Persistent Legacy\" in ''Lee and His Generals'' is a good overview of the Lost Cause movement.</ref>\n\nAfter the war, General Pickett was asked why Confederates lost at Gettysburg.

Although not seen as overwhelmingly significant at the time, particularly since the war continued for almost two years, in retrospect it has often been cited as the [[Turning point of the American Civil War|\"turning point\"]], usually in combination with the fall of Vicksburg the following day.<ref name=TP/> This is based on the observation that after Gettysburg Lee's army conducted no more strategic offensives—his army merely reacted to the initiative of [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in 1864 and 1865—and by the speculative viewpoint of the Lost Cause writers that a Confederate victory at Gettysburg might have resulted in the end of the war.<ref>McPherson, p. 665; Gallagher, ''Lee and His Generals'', pp. 207–208.</ref>\n\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|width=35%\n|quote=[The Army of the Potomac] had won a victory. It might be less of a victory than Mr. Lincoln had hoped for, but it was nevertheless a victory—and, because of that, it was no longer possible for the Confederacy to win the war. The North might still lose it, to be sure, if the soldiers or the people should lose heart, but outright defeat was no longer in the cards.\n|source=[[Bruce Catton]], ''Glory Road''<ref>Catton, p. 331.</ref>\n}}\nIt is currently a widely held view that Gettysburg was a [[decisive victory]] for the Union, but the term is considered imprecise. It is inarguable that Lee's offensive on July 3 was turned back decisively and his campaign in Pennsylvania was terminated prematurely (although the Confederates at the time argued that this was a temporary setback and that the goals of the campaign were largely met). However, when the more common definition of \"decisive victory\" is intended—an indisputable military victory of a battle that determines or significantly influences the ultimate result of a conflict—historians are divided. For example, [[David J. Eicher]] called Gettysburg a \"strategic loss for the Confederacy\" and [[James M. McPherson]] wrote that \"Lee and his men would go on to earn further laurels. But they never again possessed the power and reputation they carried into Pennsylvania those palmy summer days of 1863.\"<ref>Eicher, p. 550; McPherson, p. 665</ref>\n\nHowever, Herman Hattaway and Archer Jones wrote that the \"strategic impact of the Battle of Gettysburg was ... fairly limited.\" Steven E. Woodworth wrote that \"Gettysburg proved only the near impossibility of decisive action in the Eastern theater.\" Edwin Coddington pointed out the heavy toll on the Army of the Potomac and that \"after the battle Meade no longer possessed a truly effective instrument for the accomplishments of his task. The army needed a thorough reorganization with new commanders and fresh troops, but these changes were not made until Grant appeared on the scene in March 1864.\" Joseph T. Glatthaar wrote that \"Lost opportunities and near successes plagued the Army of Northern Virginia during its Northern invasion,\" yet after Gettysburg, \"without the distractions of duty as an invading force, without the breakdown of discipline, the Army of Northern Virginia [remained] an extremely formidable force.\" [[Ed Bearss]] wrote, \"Lee's invasion of the North had been a costly failure. Nevertheless, at best the Army of the Potomac had simply preserved the strategic stalemate in the Eastern Theater ...\"<ref>Hattaway and Jones, p. 415; Woodworth, p. xiii; Coddington, p. 573; Glatthaar, p. 288; Bearss, p. 202.</ref>  Furthermore, the Confederacy soon proved it was still capable of winning significant victories over the Northern forces in both the East ([[Battle of Cold Harbor]]) and West ([[Battle of Chickamauga]]).\n\nPeter Carmichael refers to the military context for the armies, the \"horrendous losses at Chancellorsville and Gettysburg, which effectively destroyed Lee's offensive capacity,\" implying that these cumulative losses were not the result of a single battle. Thomas Goss, writing in the U.S. Army's ''Military Review'' journal on the definition of \"decisive\" and the application of that description to Gettysburg, concludes: \"For all that was decided and accomplished, the Battle of Gettysburg fails to earn the label 'decisive battle'.\"<ref>Carmichael, p. xvii; {{cite journal|last=Goss|first=Major Thomas|date=July–August 2004|title=Gettysburg's \"Decisive Battle\"|journal=Military Review|pages=11–16|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/milreview/goss.pdf|accessdate=November 11, 2009}}</ref> The military historian [[John Keegan]] agrees. Gettysburg was a landmark battle, the largest of the war and it would not be surpassed. The Union had restored to it the belief in certain victory, and the loss dispirited the Confederacy. If \"not exactly a decisive battle\", Gettysburg was the end of Confederate use of Northern Virginia as a military buffer zone, the setting for Grant's [[Overland Campaign]].<ref>Keegan, pp. 202, 239.</ref>\n\n===Lee vs. Meade===\n[[File:George G. Meade Standing.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|alt=Photo of a balding and bearded George Meade in a military uniform. The somewhat thin figure is standing while holding a kepi.|George G. Meade]]\nPrior to Gettysburg, Robert E. Lee had established a reputation as an almost invincible general, achieving stunning victories against superior numbers—although usually at the cost of high casualties to his army—during the [[Seven Days Battles|Seven Days]], the [[Northern Virginia Campaign]] (including the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]]), [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], and [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]]. Only the [[Maryland Campaign]], with its tactically inconclusive [[Battle of Antietam]], had been less than successful. Therefore, historians have attempted to explain how Lee's winning streak was interrupted so dramatically at Gettysburg. Although the issue is tainted by attempts to portray history and Lee's reputation in a manner supporting different partisan goals, the major factors in Lee's loss arguably can be attributed to: (1) his overconfidence in the invincibility of his men; (2) the performance of his subordinates, and his management thereof; (3) his failing health, and (4) the performance of his opponent, George G. Meade, and the Army of the Potomac.\n\n[[File:Robert Edward Lee.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|alt=Photo of white-haired and bearded Robert E. Lee in a double breasted gray uniform with three stars on his collar|Robert E. Lee]]\nThroughout the campaign, Lee was influenced by the belief that his men were invincible; most of Lee's experiences with the Army of Northern Virginia had convinced him of this, including the great victory at Chancellorsville in early May and the rout of the Union troops at Gettysburg on July 1. Since morale plays an important role in military victory when other factors are equal, Lee did not want to dampen his army's desire to fight and resisted suggestions, principally by Longstreet, to withdraw from the recently captured Gettysburg to select a ground more favorable to his army. War correspondent Peter W. Alexander wrote that Lee \"acted, probably, under the impression that his troops were able to carry any position however formidable. If such was the case, he committed an error, such however as the ablest commanders will sometimes fall into.\" Lee himself concurred with this judgment, writing to President Davis, \"No blame can be attached to the army for its failure to accomplish what was projected by me, nor should it be censured for the unreasonable expectations of the public—I am alone to blame, in perhaps expecting too much of its prowess and valor.\"<ref>Sears, pp. 499–500; Glatthaar, p. 287; Fuller, p. 198, states that Lee's \"overweening confidence in the superiority of his soldiers over his enemy possessed him.\"</ref>\n\nThe most controversial assessments of the battle involve the performance of Lee's subordinates. The dominant theme of the Lost Cause writers and many other historians is that Lee's senior generals failed him in crucial ways, directly causing the loss of the battle; the alternative viewpoint is that Lee did not manage his subordinates adequately, and did not thereby compensate for their shortcomings.<ref>For example, Sears, p. 504: \"In the final analysis, it was Robert E. Lee's inability to manage his generals that went to the heart of the failed campaign.\" Glatthaar, pp. 285–86, criticizes the inability of the generals to coordinate their actions as a whole. Fuller, p. 198, states that Lee \"maintained no grip over the operations\" of his army.</ref> Two of his corps commanders—[[Richard S. Ewell]] and [[A.P. Hill]]—had only recently been promoted and were not fully accustomed to Lee's style of command, in which he provided only general objectives and guidance to their former commander, [[Stonewall Jackson]]; Jackson translated these into detailed, specific orders to his division commanders.<ref>Fuller, p. 195, for example, refers to orders to Stuart that \"were as usual vague.\" Fuller, p. 197, wrote \"As was [Lee's] custom, he relied on verbal instructions, and left all details to his subordinates.\"</ref> All four of Lee's principal commanders received criticism during the campaign and battle:<ref>Woodworth, pp. 209–10.</ref>\n* [[James Longstreet]] suffered most severely from the wrath of the Lost Cause authors, not the least because he directly criticized Lee in postbellum writings and became a [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] after the war. His critics accuse him of attacking much later than Lee intended on July 2, squandering a chance to hit the Union Army before its defensive positions had firmed up. They also question his lack of motivation to attack strongly on July 2 and 3 because he had argued that the army should have maneuvered to a place where it would force Meade to attack them. The alternative view is that Lee was in close contact with Longstreet during the battle, agreed to delays on the morning of July 2, and never criticized Longstreet's performance. (There is also considerable speculation about what an attack might have looked like before Dan Sickles moved the III Corps toward the Peach Orchard.)<ref>Sears, pp. 501–502; McPherson, pp. 656–57; Coddington, pp. 375–80; A more detailed collection of historical assessments of Longstreet at Gettysburg may be found in [[James Longstreet#Gettysburg]].</ref>\n* [[J.E.B. Stuart]] deprived Lee of cavalry intelligence during a good part of the campaign by taking his three best brigades on a path away from the army's. This arguably led to Lee's surprise at Hooker's vigorous pursuit; the meeting engagement on July 1 that escalated into the full battle prematurely; and it also prevented Lee from understanding the full disposition of the enemy on July 2. The disagreements regarding Stuart's culpability for the situation originate in the relatively vague orders issued by Lee, but most modern historians agree that both generals were responsible to some extent for the failure of the cavalry's mission early in the campaign.<ref>Sears, p. 502; A more detailed collection of historical assessments of Stuart in the Gettysburg Campaign may be found in [[J.E.B. Stuart#Gettysburg]].</ref>\n* [[Richard S. Ewell]] has been universally criticized for failing to seize the high ground on the afternoon of July 1. Once again the disagreement centers on Lee's orders, which provided general guidance for Ewell to act \"if practicable.\" Many historians speculate that Stonewall Jackson, if he had survived Chancellorsville, would have aggressively seized Culp's Hill, rendering Cemetery Hill indefensible, and changing the entire complexion of the battle. A differently worded order from Lee might have made the difference with this subordinate.<ref>McPherson, p. 654; Coddington, pp. 317–19; Eicher, pp. 517–18; Sears, p. 503.</ref>\n* [[A.P. Hill]] has received some criticism for his ineffective performance. His actions caused the battle to begin and then escalate on July 1, despite Lee's orders not to bring on a general engagement (although historians point out that Hill kept Lee well informed of his actions during the day). However, Hill's illness minimized his personal involvement in the remainder of the battle, and Lee took the explicit step of temporarily removing troops from Hill's corps and giving them to Longstreet for [[Pickett's Charge]].<ref>Sears, pp. 502–503.</ref>\n\n[[File:WinfieldSHancock.png|thumb|right|upright=0.7|alt=Photo of dark-haired and bearded Winfield S. Hancock in a dark uniform with a determined look|Winfield S. Hancock]]\nIn addition to Hill's illness, Lee's performance was affected by heart troubles, which would eventually lead to his death in 1870; he had been diagnosed with [[pericarditis]] by his staff physicians in March 1863, though modern doctors believe he had in fact suffered a heart attack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://civilwarmed.blogspot.com/2008/06/medical-department-18-lees-health-at.html|title=Civil War Medicine (and Writing): Medical Department #18 - Lee's Health at Gettysburg|first=Jim|last=Schmidt|date=June 25, 2008|publisher=}}</ref> He wrote to Jefferson Davis that his physical condition prevented him from offering full supervision in the field, and said, \"I am so dull that in making use of the eyes of others I am frequently misled.\"<ref>Sears, p. 500.</ref>\n\nAs a final factor, Lee faced a new and formidable opponent in [[George G. Meade]], and the Army of the Potomac fought well on its home territory. Although new to his army command, Meade deployed his forces relatively effectively; relied on strong subordinates such as [[Winfield S. Hancock]] to make decisions where and when they were needed; took great advantage of defensive positions; nimbly shifted defensive resources on interior lines to parry strong threats; and, unlike some of his predecessors, stood his ground throughout the battle in the face of fierce Confederate attacks.\n\nLee was quoted before the battle as saying Meade \"would commit no blunders on my front and if I make one ... will make haste to take advantage of it.\" That prediction proved to be correct at Gettysburg. Stephen Sears wrote, \"The fact of the matter is that George G. Meade, unexpectedly and against all odds, thoroughly outgeneraled Robert E. Lee at Gettysburg.\" Edwin B. Coddington wrote that the soldiers of the Army of the Potomac received a \"sense of triumph which grew into an imperishable faith in [themselves]. The men knew what they could do under an extremely competent general; one of lesser ability and courage could well have lost the battle.\"<ref>Sears, p. 506; Coddington, p. 573.</ref>\n\nMeade had his own detractors as well. Similar to the situation with Lee, Meade suffered partisan attacks about his performance at Gettysburg, but he had the misfortune of experiencing them in person. Supporters of his predecessor, Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]], lambasted Meade before the [[U.S. Congress]]'s [[Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War]], where [[Radical Republicans]] suspected that Meade was a [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperhead]] and tried in vain to relieve him from command. [[Daniel E. Sickles]] and [[Daniel Butterfield]] accused Meade of planning to retreat from Gettysburg during the battle. Most politicians, including Lincoln, criticized Meade for what they considered to be his half-hearted pursuit of Lee after the battle. A number of Meade's most competent subordinates—[[Winfield S. Hancock]], [[John Gibbon]], [[Gouverneur K. Warren]], and [[Henry J. Hunt]], all heroes of the battle—defended Meade in print, but Meade was embittered by the overall experience.<ref>Sears, pp. 505–507.</ref>\n\n==Battlefield preservation==\n{{Geobox|Protected area\n| image                       = CW Arty M1857 Napoleon front.jpg\n| image_caption               = M1857 12-Pounder \"Napoleon\" at Gettysburg National Military Park\n[[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]].\n| country                     = United States\n| country_flag                = 1\n| state                       = Pennsylvania\n| state_flag                  = 1\n| region_type                 = County\n| region                      = [[Adams County, Pennsylvania|Adams]]\n| municipality                = [[Cumberland Township, Adams County, Pennsylvania|Cumberland]]\n| municipality1               = [[Franklin Township, Adams County, Pennsylvania|Franklin]]<!--Lohr's Hill first artillery shot west of Marsh Creek--><br />[[Straban Township, Pennsylvania|Straban]]\n| parent_type                 = Campaign<br />Theater\n| parent                      = [[Gettysburg Campaign|Gettysburg]]<br />[[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern]]\n| range_type                  = Landform\n| range                       = <small>[[Devil's Den#Description|Gettysburg sill]] on the [[Newark Group|\"Gettysburg<br />plain\"]]<ref name=Brown>{{cite web |last=Brown |first=Andrew |year=2006 |origyear=1962 |title=GEOLOGY and the Gettysburg Campaign —Eleventh printing |url=http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/topogeo/education/es5/es5.pdf |location=Pennsylvania |publisher=Bureau of Topographic and Geologic Survey |accessdate=2010-02-19 <!--|quote=''the Round Tops, Cemetery Ridge, Cemetery Hill, and [[Culp's Hill|Culps Hill]] …are the '''[[outcrop]] of a diabase sill'''…the '''Gettysburg sill'''…that about 200 million years ago intruded the Triassic sandstones and shales that floor the broad [[Gettysburg plain]].''-->}}</ref> ([[York Haven]] [[Diabase]])<ref name=Smith>{{cite web |last=Smith II |first=R.C. & Keen, R.

The [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Poles]] commanded by [[Piotr Dunin]], consisting of some 2000 mercenares and Poles, decisively defeated the 2700 man army of the [[Teutonic Knights]] commanded by [[Fritz Raweneck]] and [[Kaspar Nostyc]]. Auxiliary forces sent by duke [[Eric II of Pomerania]], an ally of the Polish king, did not enter the battle.\n\n==Polish forces==\nThe Polish forces consisted mostly of the mercenaries hired by the Polish king, [[Casimir IV of Poland|Casimir IV the Jagiellon]] and the city of Danzig ([[Gdańsk]]). This army included 1000 cavalry, of which 112 were heavy cavalry, and another 1000 of infantry. 1000 cavalry and 400 infantry were mercenaries hired by Polish king, while the rest were units from Danzig ([[Gdańsk]]).\n\n==Teutonic forces==\nMost of the [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic army]], under the command of Fritz Raweneck and Kaspar Nostyc, were troops gathered from the nearby castles Mewe ([[Gniew]]), Stargard ([[Starogard Gdański]]), [[Nowe]], [[Skarszewy]] and [[Kiszewy]]. This army totalled 1000 cavalry and 400 infantry. Raweneck also had the supply chain ([[tabor (formation)|tabors]]), cannons and up to 1300 auxiliary infantry of Pomeranian peasants, used mainly for fortification works.\n\n==Battle==\nThe battle started in the evening. Adopting a relatively new tactic, Polish units built a fortified camp on the Hussite model consisting of wagons linked by a chain surrounded by a deep ditch ([[Tabor (formation)|tabor]]). The units of Raveneck and his subordinate, Kaspar Nostyc (commander from Conitz ([[Chojnice]]) also created a tabor. Piotr Dunin decided not to wait for the enemy and attacked first, setting infantry with crossbows on the left, defended by cavalry between the tabor and the coast of the nearby lake of Rogoźnica. Raveneck placed cavalry in front of his tabor, and infantry behind it, without any strategic plan. The first phase of the battle was started by a charge of Polish heavy cavalry under [[Paweł Jasieński]]. Fierce fighting continued for three hours and ended without a clear winner. After a short pause at midday, Teutonic units were able to push the Poles back; however, they found themselves under very heavy fire from crossbows of the Polish infantry, which caused huge losses and a withdrawal. During this fight Raveneck was wounded. He stopped his soldiers and tried to attack again, but this charge ended with a total defeat - Raveneck died and the rest of the cavalry surrendered or escaped. The Teutonic infantry tried to defend themselves at the tabor but its resistance was broken by a quick attack of Polish cavalry.\n\n==Casualties==\nThe Teutonic Order's army lost around 1000 soldiers, including some 300 cavalrymen. Fifty soldiers were captured. The Teutonic commander was also killed in battle and was buried in the Żarnowiec chapter church.\n\nThe Poles lost just 100 soldiers, although 150 later died from their wounds. Among the dead on the Polish side was [[Maciej Hagen]] from Gdańsk. Piotr Dunin was wounded twice.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe direct result of the battle of Świecino was that the city of Danzig and Pomerania were freed from the danger of an attack by the Teutonic Order. As a result, the royal and municipal armed forces could be used elsewhere in the war, mainly to protect the Vistula waterway and to capture the Teutonic held strongholds. This way that Teutonic forces in Prussia on the right bank of Vistula were cut off from supplies from Western Europe.\n\nThe psychological significance of the battle was that this was the first open field battle won by the royal forces, so it increased the morale of the Polish forces and lowered the morale of the Teutonic Knights. Many military historians say that the battle of Świecino was the turning point of the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454–66)|Thirteen Years' War]], leading to the final Polish victory in 1466.\n\n==External links==\n* [ Świecino near Żarnowiec Lake]\n* [http://www.zamek.malbork.com.pl/index.php?m=02&p=11 Malbork Castle - Battle of Świecino]\n\n==References==\n* Janusz Sikorski, ''Zarys historii wojskowości powszechnej do końca wieku XIX.

Or could it possibly be a word needing an English translation here?\n:IMHO, it needs to be translated [[user:JHK|JHK]]\n\nIn my (rather old) polish dictionary it means something like 'Rolling stock' or 'train'. This doesn't make sense in all cases used in the article though.\n\nTabor is\na) mountain and city in Czech, important for hussite wars\nb) some biblical mountain\nc) military term, referring to wagons connected by chains. Formation of wagons could fight and moving (something like first panzer formations) or could be fortified and became wagenburg, fortified camp, entranched camp. \nd) tabor is also army service column.\n\nTabor was very typical for Old-Polish army, it developed first however in Czech, it was then enhanced (and adapted back to Poland) by Cossacks. Other nations may also use tabors.\n\nI don't know which word use, since i am not sure if wagenburg, or descriptive \"wagons connected by chains\" will be ok to use here. I decided that i will use word tabor and i will later exaplin it's meaning in separate entry, however i guess native english speakers should know better what word would fit here [[User:szopen|szopen]]\n---\n[[user:szopen|szopen]] I am guessing you are talking about the \"War of the cities\" the Preussische Bund Hansa cities versus the Teutonic Knights ? \nWhen you write in Polish Swiecin are you referring to Schwetz at the Vistula River ? \n[[user:H.J.]]\n:This could be Battle of Schwetz, but battle of Swiecin definetely was during war between Poland and Teuton Order. Again, Prussian confederacy was _not_ only of cities, although cities, especially three of them, played big part in them. Peace which ended war was between Teutons and Poland, not between Teutons and Prussian confederacy.\n:I will add Schwetz as a German name, and i will add also redirect.

I meen the number of forces, conduct of the battle, results of the battle, involvement of Eric of Pomerania. The various sources to use are:\n\nSwiecino 1462 \n\nFought during the 13 years war with the Teutonic Order. The definitive battle that saw the Order reduced into  ruin and fall under the might of Polish overlordship. Polish army decides to charge the German Garrison near Swiecino. Assault is successful, 1,000 Germans die, 70 are captured, 200 tabors are taken including all 15 artillery pieces. Polish losses at 100 dead and 150 wounded. After this battle the Order's defenses slowly cracked. In 1463 ships under the Polish insignia of Elbing and Gdansk defeated a German flotilla at Zalewie Wislanym. Puck fell in 1464, Now in 1465. In 1466 Starogard and Chojnice. \npolisharmies.ds4a.com/greatest1/greatest1.html\n\n----\nIn 1462 Gdansk was relieved by an able commander Piotr Dunin, who with 2,000 troops defeated 2,700 men of the Order at Swiecino near Puck on 17th August. This proved to be the turning point.\n----\n\nI have rewritten the battle, adding some sections and titles, using 5 books on history and military operations. However I didn't touch the main course of the battle, which requires more work.

The uncertainty of the spelling comes from the imperfect transcribing of the Latin place-name into the Greek text (\"τῷ λεγομένῳ φόρῳ Θεμβρωνίῳ\") of George Syncellus</ref> occurred in the Roman province of [[Moesia Inferior]] (modern [[Razgrad]], [[Bulgaria]]) probably in July, 251, between the [[Roman Empire]] and a federation of [[Scythians#Migration period|Scythian]] tribesmen under the [[Goths|Goth]] king [[Cniva]]. The Romans were soundly defeated, and [[Roman emperor]]s [[Decius]] and his son [[Herennius Etruscus]] were both killed during battle. They became the first Roman emperors killed in a battle by a foreign enemy.\n\nThe battle typically marks the starting of a period of increased military and political instability in the Roman Empire, although the symptoms of the crisis had already appeared in the preceding decades.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:GothicInvasions250-251-en.svg|left|thumb|300px|Map of the invasions and the location of the battle]]Soon after Decius ascended to the throne in 249, barbarian tribes invaded the Roman provinces of [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]], [[Moesia Superior]] and [[Moesia Inferior]]. Two factors had contributed to growing unrest in the area north of Danube. First, Decius' predecessor [[Philip the Arab]] had refused to continue payments, initiated by Emperor [[Maximinus Thrax]] in 238, of annual subsidies to the aggressive tribes of the region.<ref>Southern 2001, p.347</ref> Second and more important, there were continuous movements of new peoples since the time of Emperor [[Severus Alexander]].<ref>Potter 2004, p.244</ref> Decius may also have taken with him troops from the Danube frontier, in order to depose Philip in 249.  The resultant military vacuum would inevitably attract invaders.<ref>Southern 2001, p.222. Wolfram 1988, p.45</ref>\n\nThe course of events is not clear. It seems that in 250 the [[Carpians|Carpi]] invaded Dacia, eastern [[Moesia Superior]] and western Moesia Inferior.<ref name = CAH/> At the same time, a tribal coalition under Cniva crossed the Roman frontier, probably advancing in two columns. Whether these were consisted only of Goths is rather unlikely so the name \"Scythians\" by which the Greek sources called them (a geographical definition) seems more appropriate.<ref>D. S. Potter prefers to call them \"Scythians\", since the 4th century \"Goths\" cannot be easily connected with their supposed ancestors 100 years above. See Potter 2004, p.246</ref> It is quite possible that other people of Germanic and Sarmatian origin (like [[Bastarnae]], [[Taifals]] and [[Hasdingi|Hasdingian Vandals]]), perhaps Roman deserters as well, had joined the invaders.<ref name = Wolfram1/> However, the name of the king is indeed Gothic and probably genuine.<ref name=Potter1a>Potter 2004, p.245. He suggest that, since the name Cniva doesn't appear in the fictionalized genealogy of Gothic kings by Jordanes, the latter found it in a genuine 3rd century source.</ref>\n\nThe first column of Cniva's army, a detachment of about 20,000 or so likely led by the chieftains Argaith and Gunteric, besieged [[Marcianopolis]], without success it seems.<ref>Potter 2004, p.46 and, in more detail, Wolfram 1988, pp.45,397. Although Jordanes (''Getica'', 91) places these chieftains under the command of Cniva's predecessor (a certain Ostrogotha), Wolfram and other scholars argue that it is plausible to regard their campaign as part of Cniva's invasion</ref> Then they probably headed south to besiege Philippopolis (now [[Plovdiv]] in Bulgaria). Cniva's main column under the King himself crossed Danube at [[Oescus]] then headed eastwards to [[Novae]], where he was repelled by the provincial governor (and future emperor) [[Trebonianus Gallus]].<ref name=CAH>''The Cambridge Ancient History'', vol XII, 38</ref> Then the invaders headed south to plunder [[Nicopolis ad Istrum]] where Decius defeated them but not decisively.<ref>Bird 1994, p.129</ref> After these initial setbacks, the barbarians moved southwards through [[Balkan Mountains|Haemus mountain]] and Decius pursued them (likely through the [[Shipka Pass#Shipka Pass|Shipka Pass]]) to save Philippopolis.<ref name = Wolfram2/> This time Decius' army was taken by surprise while resting at [[Stara Zagora|Beroe]]/Augusta Traiana. The Romans were heavily defeated in the ensuing [[Battle of Beroe|battle]]. Decius was forced to withdraw his army to the north at Oescus, leaving Cniva ample time to ravage Moesia and finally capture Philippopolis in the summer of 251, in part with the help of its commander, a certain [[Titus Julius Priscus]] who had proclaimed himself Emperor.<ref>Wolfram 1988, p.46, suggests summer of 250 as the date of the fall of Philippopolis and spring of 251 as the earliest date for the beginning of Cniva's returning to his base</ref> It seems that Priscus, after receiving the news of the defeat at Beroe, thought that the Goths would spare him and the city. He was wrong and was probably killed when the city fell.<ref  name=Southern1>Southern 2001, p.222. Bird 1994, p.129</ref> Then the Scythians began returning to their homeland, laden with booty and captives, among them many of senatorial rank.<ref name = Wolfram2/>\n\nIn the meantime, Decius had returned with his re-organized army, accompanied by his son Herennius Etruscus and the general [[Trebonianus Gallus]], intending to defeat the invaders and recover the booty.\n\n==Battle==\nProbably in July<ref>Herwig Wolfram, ''Die Goten und ihre Geschichte'', C. H. Beck Verlag, München, 2001, p.33. {{ISBN|3-406-44779-1}}</ref> or August<ref>Southern 2001, p.308. She conjectures August as the date of Herennius Etruscus proclamation to the rank of Augustus, then the battle could not take place before that point</ref> of 251, the Roman army engaged the Scythians under Cniva near Abritus. The strengths of the bellingerent forces are unknown, but we know that Cniva divided his forces into three units, with one of these parts concealed behind a swamp.<ref name = Potter2/> It seems that Cniva was a skilled tactician and that he was very familiar with the surrounding terrain.<ref name=Wolfram1>Wolfram 1988, p.45</ref> Jordanes and Aurelius Victor claim that<ref>Jordanes, par.103. Aurelius Victor, par.29</ref> Herennius Etruscus was killed by an arrow during a skirmish before the outset of the battle and that his father addressed his soldiers as if the loss of his son did not matter. He allegedly said, \"Let no one mourn. The death of one soldier is not a great loss to the Republic\". However, other sources state that Herennius died with his father.<ref name=Potter3>Potter 2004, p.247</ref>\n\n[[File:Abritus Razgrad Kaladan 1.jpg|right|thumb|Roman ruins at Abritus, site of the battle]]\nThe manoeuvre of the Scythians was ultimately successful. Decius' forces defeated their opponents in the front line, but made the fatal mistake of pursuing their fleeing enemy into the swamp, where they were ambushed and routed. The immense slaughter marked one of the most catastrophic defeats in the history of the Roman Empire and resulted in the death of Decius himself.<ref name=Potter2>Potter 2004, p.246</ref> [[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]]<ref>Zonaras, 12.20, a free translation of the following Greek text: \"καὶ αὐτός τε σὺν τῷ υἱῷ καὶ πλῆθος τῶν ̔Ρωμαίων ἐνεπεπτώκει τῷ τέλματι, καὶ πάντες ἐκεῖσε ἀπώλοντο, ὡς μηδὲ τὰ σώματα αὐτῶν εὑρεθῆναι, καταχωσθέντα τῇ ἰλύϊ τοῦ τέλματος\"</ref> vividly narrates how: <blockquote>\"He and his son and a large number of Romans fell into the marshland; all of them perished there, none of their bodies to be found, as they were covered by the mud.\"</blockquote>\n\nA 6th-century Byzantine scholar, [[Zosimus]] also described the total massacre of Decius' troops and the fall of the pagan emperor:\n            \n\"Proceeding therefore incautiously in an unknown place, he and his army became entangled in the mire, and under that disadvantage were so assailed by the missiles of the Barbarians, that not one of them escaped with life. Thus ended the life of the excellent emperor Decius.\"\n\n[[Lactantius]], a 4th-century [[early Christian]] and advisor to Roman Emperor [[Constantine the Great]], described the emperor's demise as following :<ref>Lactantius, chapter 4</ref>\n<blockquote>\"he was suddenly surrounded by the barbarians, and slain, together with great part of his army; nor could he be honoured with the rites of sepulture, but, stripped and naked, he lay to be devoured by wild beasts and birds, a fit end for the enemy of [[God]].\"</blockquote>\n\nThe supposedly treacherous behavior of Treboniannus Gallus who, according to Zosimus,<ref>Zosimus, 1.25</ref> signalled the final Gothic assault is not accepted today. It seems impossible that the shattered Roman legions proclaimed emperor a traitor who was responsible for the loss of so many soldiers from their ranks. Another strong point against Gallus' treason is the fact that he adopted [[Hostilian]], the younger son of Decius, after returning to Rome.<ref name=Potter3>Potter 2004, p.247</ref><ref name=Southern2>Southern 2001, p.308</ref>\n\nThe long-debated location of Abritus was finally established (1&nbsp;km east of the city of Razgrad) after the excavations published by T. Ivanov in 1969 and 1971.<ref>Ivanov and Stojanof 1985, p.1</ref> According to recent findings, the location of the battle is about 15 kilometres northwest of Abritus, in the valley of the river [[Beli Lom]], to the south of the village of Dryanovets.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.academia.edu/13213004/The_Battle_of_Abrittus_the_Imperial_Treasury_and_Aurei_in_Barbaricum_Numismatic_Chronicle_173_2013_s._151-170|title=The Battle of Abrittus, the Imperial Treasury and Aurei in Barbaricum, Numismatic Chronicle 173, 2013, s. 151-170.|access-date=2016-10-16}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nGallus, who became emperor upon Decius' death, negotiated a treaty with the Goths under duress, which allowed them to keep their booty and return to their homes on the other side of the Danube. It is also possible that he agreed to pay  an annual tribute in return for the Goths' promise to respect Roman territory.<ref>Southern 2001, p.76</ref> This humiliating treaty, the contemporary spread of [[Plague of Cyprian]] with its devastating effects and the chaotic situation in the East with the Sassanian invasions left Gallus with a very bad reputation amongst the latter Roman historians. However, D. S. Potter suggests that, before the defeat at Abritus, the situation was not so serious that the available Roman forces would not be able to manage the invasions. Therefore, it is Decius' bad conduct which was responsible for the disastrous turn of the events.<ref name=Potter1>Potter 2004, p.245</ref> In any case, Gallus had no choice but to get rid of the Goths as soon as possible.<ref name=Wolfram2>Wolfram 1988, p.46</ref>\n\n[[Ammianus Marcellinus]] rated this reverse with the most serious military disasters of the [[Roman Empire]] to his time: [[Publius Quinctilius Varus|Varus']] defeat at the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]], the incursions of the [[Marcomanni]] during the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]], and the [[Battle of Adrianople (378)|Battle of Adrianople]].<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''History (Res Gestae)'', 31.12.13, in ''Loeb Classical Library'', Harvard University Press, 1939&ndash;2001, 479</ref>\n\nIn 271, the Emperor [[Aurelian]] conclusively defeated the Goths and killed their king Cannobaudes in battle.

It was a battle of a Cossack rebellion in Ukraine that took place in the years 1648–1657 after the expiration of a two-year truce.<ref>Tucker, S.C., editor, ''A Global Chronology of Conflict, Volume II: 1500–1774'', Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2010, {{ISBN|9781851096671}}, p. 621</ref> Fought  from 28 to 30 June 1651, the battle took place in the province of [[Volhynia]], on the hilly plain south of the [[Styr River]].<ref>Hrushevsky, pp. 304–305</ref>  The Polish camp was on the river opposite Berestechko and faced south, towards the Cossack army about two kilometers away, whose right flank was against the [[River Pliashivka]] (Pliashova) and the Tatar army on their left flank.<ref>Hrushevsky, pp. 304 and 313</ref>  It was probably the largest European land battle of the 17th century.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}\n\n==Armies==\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}\nThe number of Polish troops is uncertain. One of the senior Polish commanders, Duke [[Bogusław Radziwiłł]], wrote that the Polish army had 80,000 soldiers,<ref>Jan Widacki, ''Kniaź Jarema'' p. 255.</ref> which included \"40,000 regulars and 40,000 nobles of the ''levée en masse'', accompanied by roughly the same number of various servants, footmen, and such.\"<ref name=\"Hrushevsky, p. 304\">Hrushevsky, p. 304</ref>  Some modern historians, such as Zbigniew Wójcik, Józef Gierowski, and [[Władysław Czapliński]], have reduced this figure to 60,000-63,000 soldiers.<ref>Zbigniew Wójcik, ''Jan Kazimierz Waza'', p. 75; Władysław Czapliński, ''Glosa do Trylogii'', p. 45; Józef Gierowski, ''Historia Polski'', p. 223.</ref>\n\nThere is no reliable source on the number of Cossack and Crimean Tatar troops. The possible estimates range from 80,000 men<ref>Tadeusz Wasilewski, ''Ostatni Waza na polskim tronie.'' p. 103.</ref> to 200,000 men.<ref>\"Cyprian Pawel Brzostowski's letter of 9 July [N.S.] from the camp\" according to Hrushevsky, p. 304</ref> The core of Cossack army at Berestechko consisted of 12 regiments named after towns they were stationed in (list numbers provided according to the [[Treaty of Zboriv]] (1649)):\n*[[Chyhyryn]] Regiment (Colonel [[Mykhailo Krysa]]) - 3220 cossacks\n*[[Cherkasy]] Regiment (Colonel [[Yakiv Voronchenko]]) - 2990 cossacks\n*[[Korsun-Shevchenkivskyi|Korsun]] Regiment (Colonel [[Ivan Gulyanitsky]]) - 3470 cossacks\n*[[Bila Tserkva]] Regiment (Colonel [[Mykhailo Gromyka]]) - 2990 cossacks\n*[[Uman]] Regiment (Colonel [[Yosyp Glukh]]) - 2977 cossacks\n*[[Bratslav]] Regiment (Colonel [[Danylo Nechay]]) - 2662 cossacks\n*[[Vinnytsya]] Regiment (Colonel [[Ivan Bohun]]) - 2050 cossacks\n*[[Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi|Pereyaslav]] Regiment (Colonel [[Fedir Loboda]]) - 2986 cossacks\n*[[Kropyvna]] Regiment (Colonel [[Dzhulaibek|Filon Dzhelaliy]]) - 1993 cossacks\n*[[Myrhorod]] Regiment (Colonel [[Matviy Hladky]]) - 3009 cossacks\n*[[Poltava]] Regiment (Colonel [[Martyn Pushkar]]) - 2970 cossacks\n*[[Pryluky]] Regiment (Colonel [[Tymofiy Nosach]]) - 1996 cossacks\n\nA total of 33,313 registered Cossacks from the above. Additional 5 Cossack regiments (of [[Kiev]], [[Kaniv]], [[Chernigiv]], [[Nizhyn]], [[Pavoloch]]) didn't participate in the battle being deployed mostly against the Lithuanian forces of [[Janusz Radziwiłł (1612–1655)|Janusz Radziwiłł]] advancing on Kiev. The registered Cossack force was supported by a large number of Ukrainian peasants armed with scythes, flails and the likes which were rather undisciplined and organised poorly. The Crimean Tatar horde is estimated to 28,000–33,000 men, though might be lower. There were also 2 thousand Don Cossacks and a few thousand of [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Vlachs]].\n\nOn 19 June 1651, the Polish army numbered 14,844 Polish cavalry, 2,250 German-style cavalry, 11,900 German-style infantry and dragoons, 2,950 Hungarian-style infantry (''[[haiduks]]''), 1,550 Lithuanian volunteers, and 960 [[Lipka Tatars]].<ref>Tadeusz Wasilewski, ''Ostatni Waza na polskim tronie.'' p. 102.</ref> There were also 16,000 German mercenaries who suffered from disease and hunger due to a delayed pay and inflated food prices in the camp.<ref name=\"Igor Svieshnikov, p. 103\">Igor Svieshnikov, p. 103</ref> A number of [[registered Cossacks]] remained loyal and participated in the battle on the Polish side. Many [[magnate]]s brought in their large private armies. In addition, there was a huge militia force, of limited value, numbering 30,000 noblemen of the ''[[pospolite ruszenie|levée en masse]]''.\n\nThe Polish commanders were hoping to break the Cossack ranks with a charge of the Polish [[Winged Hussars]], a tactic that had proven effective in many previous battles, including at [[Battle of Kircholm|Kircholm]], and [[Battle of Kluszyn|Kłuszyn]] (and which would later prove successful at the 1683 [[Battle of Vienna]] against the Turks).\n\nThe Cossack army was well acquainted with this Polish style of war, having had much experience fighting against the Poles and alongside them. Their preferred tactic was to avoid an open field battle, and to fight from the cover of a huge fortified camp.\n\n==First day of battle==\n2000 Polish cavalry (one regiment under the command of [[Aleksander Koniecpolski (1620-1659)|Aleksander Koniecpolski]], supported by [[Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski|Jerzy Lubomirski]], six [[Towarzysz pancerny|pancerni]] cavalry companies of [[Jeremi Wiśniowiecki]] and [[Winged Hussars]] under the command of [[Stefan Czarniecki]]) repulsed the Tatars, who suffered heavy losses.\nDuring the first day of \"skirmishes by the Tatar and Cossack vanguard regiments\", the Poles were victorious \"since their army sustained that first attack cheerfully and in high spirits\".<ref name=\"H305\">Hrushevsky, p. 305</ref>\n\n==Second day of battle==\nThe Poles, encouraged by their success on the first day, deployed all their available cavalry against the \"main Tatar horde\" and \"Cossack vanguard regiments\".<ref name=\"H305\" /> The Polish infantry and artillery remained in camp and did not support the cavalry. This time, Tatar cavalry gained the upper hand, pushing the Poles back to their camp but were then \"barely repelled\" by heavy fire from the Polish infantry and artillery.<ref name=\"H305\" /> The Poles lost 300 of szlachta, including many officers of \"caliber\", and the \"escort troop of [[Hetman]] Mikołaj Potocki\".<ref name=\"H305\" /> During the second day of the battle, the rebels were victorious, although \"the Tatars, too, were unpleasantly surprised by the determination and endurance of the Polish army in both battles and, having suffered rather painful losses of their own, they lost heart\".<ref name=\"H305\" /> Toğay bey and Khan's brother-in-law Mehmet Giray were killed.\n\n==Third day of battle==\nThe \"king insisted, at a night council, on engaging the enemy in a decisive battle the next day, Friday, 30 June\".<ref name=\"H305\" />  The Polish army appeared out of the \"morning mist in full strength\" but only the Tatars engaged in skirmishes which was met by the Polish artillery.<ref name=\"H305\" /> The Cossack defences consisted of two fortified camps, a larger for the registered Cossacks and a smaller for the peasant militia, both protected by 10 lines of chained wagons.<ref name=\"Igor Svieshnikov, p. 108\">Igor Svieshnikov, p. 108</ref> At 3 p.m. Duke [[Jeremi Wiśniowiecki]] led a successful charge of 18 cavalry companies against the right wing of the Cossack-Tatar army and \"the zealous cavalry attack was a success: it broke up the rows of Cossack infantry and the wagons moving in corral formation\".<ref name=\"Hrushevsky, p. 306\">Hrushevsky, p. 306</ref> However the Cossacks regrouped, pushed the Polish cavalry out of the camp and advanced further with a help of the Tatars. The left flank of the Polish army started to retreat when the King reinforced it with all German mercenaries under command of Colonel Houwaldt who repulsed the attack and \"drove the Tatars from the field\".<ref name=\"Hrushevsky, p. 306\"/><ref name=\"Igor Svieshnikov, p. 109\">Igor Svieshnikov, p. 109</ref> During the fighting, a Polish nobleman called Otwinowski noticed the Tatar Khan's standard, and Polish artillery was directed to fire at it. Khan's brother Amurat was wounded mortally. With the battle already turning against them, the Tatar forces panicked, \"abandoning the Khan's camp as it stood\", and fled the battlefield leaving most of their belongings behind. Khmelnytsky and Vyhovsky with a few Cossacks chased Khan attempting to bring him with his force back, but were taken hostage to be released when the battle was over.<ref>Hrushevsky, pp. 306–307</ref> A heavy rain started which complicated cavalry operations. With the Tatar cavalry gone, the Cossacks moved their wagons in the night to a better defensive position closer to the river, dug trenches and constructed walls to the Polish surprise in the morning.\n\n==The siege of the Cossack camp==\nThe Polish army and Cossack camp exchanged artillery fire for ten days while both sides built fortifications. The Poles tried to blockade the camp.<ref>Hrushevsky, pp. 314 and 316</ref> Leaderless without Khmelnytsky, the Cossacks were commanded by Colonel Filon Dzhalalii, who was replaced by [[Ivan Bogun|Ivan Bohun]] on July 9. Other accounts state the commander was Matvii Hladky.<ref>Hrushevsky, pp. 314–315</ref> The Cossack morale was decreasing and desertions started to the other river side, though they maintained a high rate of artillery fire and made occasional sorties. When the offered terms for surrender were rejected, the Poles prepared to dam the Pliashivka River so as to flood the Cossack camp. [[Stanisław Lanckoroński (hetman)|Stanisław Lanckoroński]] with a 2 thousand cavalry force moved across the river on July 9 to complete encirclement of the Cossacks. When they found out of the Polish advance, Bohun called for a council with other leaders of the registered Cossacks on further actions.<ref>Hrushevsky, pp. 317–318</ref> However none of the peasant militia was invited to the council. The Cossacks built 3 bridges and Bohun led 2 thousand cavalry with 2 cannons to the other river side by the morning of July 10 to attack Lanckoroński. The uninformed peasants thought they were abandoned, started to panic and flee across the river.<ref>Hrushevsky, p. 318</ref> Lanckoroński didn't expect a large movement in his direction and retreated. Bohun returned to the camp and tried to restore order, but in vain. The main Polish force observed the disorder, but didn't launch an attack on the Cossack camp immediately thinking of a trap. They assaulted eventually, breached the defences and made their way to the river crossing. A few Cossack regiments managed to retreat in order though. Some Cossacks drowned, but archaeological excavations on the river crossing site revealed about a hundred Cossack human remains all having damage due to cold weapons to their bones which suggested heavy fighting. A rearguard of 200 to 300 Cossacks protected the river crossing; all of them were killed in battle rejecting surrender offers. \"Khmelnytsky's tent was captured intact, with all his belongings\", which included two banners, one he received from John II Casimir's 1649 commission and one from [[Wladyslaw IV]] in 1646.<ref>Hrushevsky, pp. 321–322</ref> Although it was difficult to estimate how many Cossacks and peasants were killed in the retreat, Piasecki and Brzostowski, who participated in the battle, mentioned 3,000 killed. Tsar's ambassador [[podyachy]] Bogdanov in his report to Moscow mentioned 4,000 killed.<ref name=\"Igor Svieshnikov, p. 124\">Igor Svieshnikov, p. 124</ref> Most Cossack artillery pieces were either lost to the Poles or drowned in the marshes. Many spoils were collected in the Cossack camp including the army treasury of 30 thousand talers.\n\n===Schematic map of the battle===\n[[File:Bitwa pod Beresteczkiem.jpg|1000px|center]]\n\n==Aftermath==\nAs the battle ended, King John Casimir made the error of not pressing even harder the pursuit of the fleeing Cossacks, \"the first several days following ... defeat of the enemy were so blatantly wasted\" but there \"was the unwillingness of the nobility's levée en masse to proceed into Ukraine\" plus \"rainy weather and a lack of food and fodder, coupled with epidemics and diseases that were becoming active in the army, were generally undercutting any energy for war\".<ref name=\"Hrushevsky, p. 361\">Hrushevsky, p. 361</ref> The \"king left the whole army to Potocki\" on 17 July [N.S.] and returned \"to Warsaw to celebrate his victories over the Cossacks\".<ref name=\"Hrushevsky, p. 361\"/> After making promises of a pecuniary nature, Khmelnytsky was soon released by the Tatar Khan. He was then able to reassemble the Cossack host, which was able to present a substantial army to confront the Poles at the [[Battle of Bila Tserkva (1651)]]. Poland and \"the bulk of the rebels make peace in the [[Treaty of Bila Tserkva]]\" on 28 September 1651, which \"reduces the number of registered Cossacks from 40,000 to 20,000 and deprives them of the right to settle in or control various provinces of Ukraine previously allowed to them under the [[Treaty of Zboriv]]\".<ref name=\"Tucker, p. 622\">Tucker, p. 622</ref> The Ukrainian revolt, far from ending, would continue for several more years under Khmelnytsky.<ref name=\"Tucker, p. 622\"/>\n[[Image:Battle of Beresteczko 1651.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Battle of Berestechko by Vernier]]\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Samuel Twardowski]]'s narrative poem, ''The Civil War'', describes the setting for the battle along the Styr River:<ref>Hrushevsky, pp. 303–304</ref>\n\n<poem>\nThere is a little town on it,\nIn the middle of Volhynia, called Berestechko,\nBelonging to the Leszczynski family, that was not as famous in the past\nAs it has now become – both ancient [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]]\nAnd [[Khotyn]] are far outshone by it, because as many heads here\nOur eyes have seen as at [[Thermopylae]]\nOr [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]] they counted, although there the whole strength\nOf Europe and Asia had come together.\nSince our arrival – hilly roads\nAnd steep slopes, until open\nMeadows unfold near the Styr's\nLow banks. It was pleasant to look from the south\nAt the pyramid of the Pronskis and the groves that are green\nIn winter always. And to th east there lies as if a natural\nField for a camp – and there it was indeed placed\nLater, but first – this was pondered for a long time.\n</poem>\n\nThe Battle of Berestechko is commemorated on the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw]], with the inscription \"BERESTECZKO 28-30 VI 1651\".\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* http://www.kismeta.com/diGrasse/Berest.htm\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20161112212930/https://www.msz.gov.pl/resource/21badcbf-0c18-4fb8-8b19-3d382469d25f%3AJCR ''Winged Hussars''], Radoslaw Sikora, Bartosz Musialowicz, ''BUM Magazine'', 2016.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Battle Of Berestechko}}\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1651]]\n[[Category:Battles of the Khmelnytsky Uprising|Berestechko]]\n[[Category:Battles involving the Crimean Khanate]]\n[[Category:Volyn Oblast]]"}

It comprised a force which included 50 warships, of which 17 were aircraft carriers; while the British [[armoured flight deck|armored flight decks]] meant that fewer planes could be carried in a single aircraft carrier, they were more resistant to ''kamikaze'' strikes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nAlthough all the aircraft carriers were provided by Britain, the carrier group was a combined [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] fleet with British, [[Royal Canadian Navy|Canadian]], [[Royal New Zealand Navy|New Zealand]] and [[Royal Australian Navy|Australian]] ships and personnel.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Their mission was to neutralize Japanese [[Military airbase|airfields]] in the [[Sakishima Islands]] and provide air cover against Japanese ''kamikaze'' attacks.

Hiromichi Yahara]]\n\nThe Japanese land [[Military campaign|campaign]] (mainly [[defense (military)|defensive]]) was conducted by the 67,000-strong (77,000 according to some sources) [[regular army|regular]] [[Thirty-Second Army (Japan)|32nd Army]] and some 9,000 [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) troops at Oroku naval base (only a few hundred of whom had been trained and equipped for ground combat), supported by 39,000 [[Conscription|drafted]] local [[Ryukyuan people]] (including 24,000 hastily drafted [[Rear (military)|rear]] [[militia]] called ''[[Boeitai]]'' and 15,000 non-uniformed laborers). The Japanese had used ''[[kamikaze]]'' tactics since the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], but for the first time, they became a major part of the defense. Between the American landing on April 1 and May 25, seven major ''kamikaze'' attacks were attempted, involving more than 1,500 planes.\n\nThe 32nd Army initially consisted of the [[9th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|9th]], [[24th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|24th]], and [[62nd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|62nd]] Divisions, and the 44th Independent Mixed Brigade. The 9th Division was moved to [[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]] before the [[invasion]], resulting in shuffling of Japanese defensive plans. Primary resistance was to be led in the south by Lieutenant General [[Mitsuru Ushijima]], his [[chief of staff]], Lieutenant General [[Isamu Chō]] and his chief of operations, Colonel [[Hiromichi Yahara]]. Yahara advocated a defensive [[Military strategy|strategy]], whilst Chō advocated an [[Offensive (military)|offensive]] one.\n\nIn the north, Colonel Takehido Udo was in command. The IJN troops were led by [[Rear Admiral]] [[Minoru Ōta]]. They expected the Americans to land 6–10 [[division (military)|divisions]] against the Japanese garrison of two and a half divisions. The staff calculated that superior quality and numbers of weapons gave each US division five or six times the [[firepower]] of a Japanese division. To this, would be added the Americans' abundant naval and air firepower.\n\n===Military use of children===\nIn Okinawa island, [[middle school]] boys were organized into [[front line|front-line]]-service Tekketsu Kinnōtai, while [[Himeyuri students]] were organized into a [[nurse|nursing]] unit.<ref name=command>Huber, Thomas M.{{cite web|url=http://www-cgsc.army.mil/carl/resources/csi/Huber/Huber.asp |title=Japan's Battle of Okinawa, March–June 1945 |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214183638/http://www-cgsc.army.mil/carl/resources/csi/Huber/Huber.asp |archivedate=February 14, 2009 |df=mdy}}, [[Command and General Staff College]]</ref>\n\nThe [[Japanese Imperial Army]] mobilized 1,780 [[middle school]] boys aged 14–17 years into front-line-service. They were named \"Tekketsu Kinnōtai\" ([[:ja:鉄血勤皇隊]], Iron and Blood Imperial Corps). This mobilization was conducted by the ordinance of the Ministry of Army, not by law.\n\nThe ordinances mobilized the student as a volunteer soldier for form's sake. In reality, the military authorities ordered schools to force almost all students to \"volunteer\" as soldiers. Sometimes they counterfeited the necessary documents. About half of Tekketsu Kinnōtai were killed, including in suicide bomb attacks against tanks, and in guerrilla operations.\n\nAfter losing the Battle of Okinawa, the Japanese government enacted new laws in preparation for the decisive battles in the main islands. These laws made it possible for boys aged 15 or older and girls aged 17 or older to be drafted into [[front line|front-line]]-service.\n\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:Childsoldier In Okinawa.jpg|Tekketsu Kinnōtai teenage soldiers\nFile:Ie defence positions.png|A US military diagram of typical Japanese hill defensive tunnels and installations\nFile:150-mm-japanese-gun-okinawa.jpg|A Japanese Type 89 150mm gun hidden inside a cave defensive system\nFile:Okinawa airfields 1945.jpg|A map of Okinawa's airfields, 1945\n</gallery>\n\n==Naval battle==\n{{Quote box|align=right|width=25%|quote=There was a hypnotic fascination to the sight so alien to our Western philosophy.

Until April 27, a minimum of 14 and up to 18 escort carriers (CVEs) were in the area at all times, and until April 20 British Task Force 57, with 4 large and 6 escort carriers, remained off the Sakishima Islands to protect the southern flank.<ref>{{cite web |title=OKINAWA: THE LAST BATTLE, Chapter 4, Page 97 |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/okinawa/chapter4.htm |accessdate=June 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe protracted length of the campaign under stressful conditions forced Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]] to take the unprecedented step of relieving the principal naval commanders to rest and recuperate. Following the practice of changing the fleet designation with the change of commanders, US naval forces began the campaign as the [[United States Fifth Fleet|US 5th Fleet]] under Admiral [[Raymond Spruance]], but ended it as the [[United States Third Fleet|3rd Fleet]] under Admiral [[William Halsey]].\n\nJapanese air opposition had been relatively light during the first few days after the landings. However, on April 6, the expected air reaction began with an attack by 400 planes from [[Kyushu]]. Periodic heavy air attacks continued through April. During the period March 26&nbsp;– April 30, twenty American ships were sunk and 157 damaged by enemy action. For their part, by April 30, the Japanese had lost more than 1,100 planes to Allied naval forces alone.<ref>{{cite web|title=OKINAWA: THE LAST BATTLE, Chapter 4, Page 102|url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/okinawa/chapter4.htm|accessdate=June 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\nBetween April 6 and June 22, the Japanese flew 1,465 ''kamikaze'' aircraft in large-scale attacks from Kyushu, 185 individual ''kamikaze'' sorties from Kyushu, and 250 individual ''kamikaze'' sorties from [[Formosa]]. While US intelligence estimated there were 89 planes on Formosa, the Japanese actually had about 700, dismantled or well camouflaged and dispersed into scattered villages and towns; the US [[Fifth Air Force]] disputed Navy claims of ''kamikaze'' coming from Formosa.<ref>Baldwin, Hanson W.

While no major Allied warships were lost, several fleet carriers were severely damaged. Land-based [[Shin'yō-class suicide motorboat]]s were also used in the Japanese [[suicide attack]]s, although Ushijima had disbanded the majority of the suicide boat battalions prior to the battle due to expected low effectiveness against a superior enemy. The boat crews were re-formed into three additional infantry battalions.<ref>Christopher Chant, \"The Encyclopedia of Codenames of World War II (Routledge Revivals)\", p. 87</ref>\n\n===Operation ''Ten-Go''===\n{{Main article|Operation Ten-Go}}\n[[File:Yamato battleship explosion.jpg|thumb|The super battleship {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}} explodes after persistent attacks from US aircraft.]]\n\nOperation ''Ten-Go'' (''Ten-gō sakusen'') was the attempted attack by a strike force of 10 Japanese surface vessels, led by the [[Dreadnought#Super-dreadnoughts|super battleship]] {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}} and commanded by [[List of Imperial Japanese Navy admirals|Admiral]] [[Seiichi Itō]]. This small task force had been ordered to fight through enemy naval forces, then beach ''Yamato'' and fight from shore using her guns as [[coastal artillery]] and crew as [[naval infantry]]. The ''Ten-Go'' force was spotted by [[submarine]]s shortly after it left the Japanese home waters, and was intercepted by US carrier aircraft.\n\nUnder attack from more than 300 aircraft over a two-hour span, the world's largest battleship sank on April 7, 1945, after a one-sided battle, long before she could reach Okinawa. US [[torpedo bomber]]s were instructed to aim for only one side to prevent effective counter flooding by the battleship's crew, and hitting preferably the bow or stern, where armor was believed to be the thinnest. Of ''Yamato'''s screening force, the [[light cruiser]] {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Yahagi|1942|2}} and 4 of the 8 destroyers were also sunk. The Imperial Japanese Navy lost some 3,700 sailors, including Admiral Itō, at the cost of 10 US aircraft and 12 airmen.\n\n===British Pacific Fleet===\n[[File:HMS Formidable (67) on fire 1945.jpg|thumb|The ''[[HMS Formidable (67)|HMS Formidable]]'' on fire after a [[kamikaze]] attack on May 4.

On April 10, its attention was shifted to airfields on northern [[Taiwan (island)|Formosa]]. The force withdrew to [[San Pedro Bay (Philippines)|San Pedro Bay]] on April 23.\n\nOn May 1, the British Pacific Fleet returned to action, subduing the airfields as before, this time with naval [[bombardment]] as well as aircraft. Several ''kamikaze'' attacks caused significant damage, but since the British had armored [[flight deck]]s on their aircraft carriers, they experienced only a brief interruption to their force's operations.<ref>{{harvnb|Hastings|2007|p=401}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hobbs|2011|pp=175–76}}</ref>\n\n==Land battle==\n{{refimprove|section |date=December 2016}}\n[[File:New Mexico class battleship bombarding Okinawa.jpg|thumb|The battleship {{USS|Idaho|BB-42|6}} shells Okinawa on April 1, 1945.]]\n\nThe land battle took place over about 81 days beginning on April 1, 1945. The first Americans ashore were soldiers of the 77th Infantry Division, who landed in the [[Kerama Islands]], {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of Okinawa on March 26. Subsidiary landings followed, and the Kerama group was secured over the next five days. In these preliminary operations, the 77th Infantry Division suffered 27 dead and 81 wounded, while Japanese dead and captured numbered over 650. The operation provided a protected anchorage for the fleet and eliminated the threat from suicide boats.\n\nOn March 31, Marines of the [[Fleet Marine Force Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion]] landed without opposition on Keise Shima, four islets just {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of the Okinawan capital of [[Naha, Okinawa|Naha]]. A group of [[155 mm Long Tom|{{convert|155|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} \"Long Tom\"]] artillery pieces went ashore on the islets to cover operations on Okinawa.\n\n===Northern Okinawa===\n[[File:Marines land on Okinawa shores.jpg|thumb|United States Marine Corps|[[United States Marine Corps|US Marine]] reinforcements wade ashore to support the [[beachhead]] on Okinawa, April 1, 1945.]]\n\nThe main landing was made by the [[XXIV Corps (United States)|XXIV Corps]] and the [[III Amphibious Corps]] on the Hagushi beaches on the western coast of Okinawa on L-Day, April 1, which was both Easter Sunday and [[April Fools' Day]] in 1945. The 2nd Marine Division conducted a [[demonstration (military)|demonstration]] off the Minatoga beaches on the southeastern coast to deceive the Japanese about American intentions and delay movement of [[Military reserve|reserves]] from there.\n\nThe 10th Army swept across<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USMC/USMC-M-Okinawa/USMC-M-Okinawa-6.html|title=Action in the North, Chp 6 of Okinawa: Victory in the Pacific by Major Chas.

In light of the weak opposition, General Buckner decided to proceed immediately with Phase II of his plan—the seizure of northern Okinawa. The [[6th Marine Division]] headed up the [[Ishikawa Isthmus]] and by April 7, had sealed off the [[Motobu Peninsula]].\n\nSix days later on April 13, the 2nd Battalion, [[22nd Marine Regiment]], reached Hedo Point ([[Hedo-misaki]]) at the northernmost tip of the island. By this point, the bulk of the Japanese forces in the north (codenamed ''Udo Force'') was cornered on the Motobu Peninsula. Here, the terrain was mountainous and wooded, with the Japanese defenses concentrated on [[Yae-Dake]], a twisted mass of rocky ridges and ravines on the center of the peninsula. There was heavy fighting before the Marines finally cleared Yae-Dake on April 18.\n\nMeanwhile, the [[77th Infantry Division (United States)|77th Infantry Division]] assaulted Ie Island ([[Ie Shima]])—a small island off the western end of the peninsula—on April 16. In addition to conventional hazards, the 77th Infantry Division encountered ''kamikaze'' attacks, and even local women armed with spears. There was heavy fighting before the area was declared secured on April 21, and became another air base for operations against Japan.\n\n===Southern Okinawa===\n[[File:OkinawaMarinesDeadJapanese.jpg|thumb|US Marines pass a dead Japanese soldier in a destroyed village, April 1945.]]\n[[File:OkinawaMarineCaveDemolition.jpg|thumb|A [[6th Marine Division (United States)|6th Marine Division]] demolition crew watches explosive charges detonate and destroy a Japanese cave, May 1945.]]\n[[File:Americans on Okinawa hear of victory in Europe.jpg|thumb|American soldiers of the [[77th Infantry Division (United States)|77th Infantry Division]] listen impassively to radio reports of [[Victory in Europe Day]] on May 8, 1945.]]\n\nWhile the 6th Marine Division cleared northern Okinawa, the US Army 96th and 7th Infantry Divisions wheeled south across the narrow waist of Okinawa. The 96th Infantry Division began to encounter fierce resistance in west-central Okinawa from Japanese troops holding fortified positions east of Highway No. 1 and about {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on|0}} northwest of Shuri, from what came to be known as [[Cactus Ridge]]. The 7th Infantry Division encountered similarly fierce Japanese opposition from a rocky pinnacle located about {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}} southwest of Arakachi (later dubbed \"[[The Pinnacle, Battle of Okinawa|The Pinnacle]]\").<!--Former edit specified that the 6th Marine Division was heading south after the XXIV corps was done clearing the north (wrong). 2nd Marine Division were not introduced until later in the campaign--> By the night of April 8, American troops had cleared these and several other strongly fortified positions. They suffered over 1,500 battle casualties in the process, while killing or capturing about 4,500 Japanese, yet the battle had only begun, for it was now realized they were merely outposts guarding the Shuri Line.\n\nThe next American objective was [[Kakazu Ridge]], two hills with a connecting saddle that formed part of Shuri's outer defenses. The Japanese had prepared their positions well and fought tenaciously. The Japanese soldiers hid in fortified caves. American forces often lost personnel before clearing the Japanese out from each cave or other hiding place. The Japanese sent Okinawans at gunpoint out to obtain water and supplies for them, which led to civilian casualties. The American advance was inexorable, but resulted in a high number of casualties on both sides.\n\nAs the American assault against Kakazu Ridge stalled, Lieutenant General Ushijima — influenced by General Chō — decided to take the offensive. On the evening of April 12, the 32nd Army attacked American positions across the entire front. The Japanese attack was heavy, sustained, and well organized. After fierce [[close combat]], the attackers retreated, only to repeat their offensive the following night. A final assault on April 14 was again repulsed. The effort led the 32nd Army's staff to conclude that the Americans were vulnerable to night [[infiltration tactics]], but that their superior firepower made any offensive Japanese troop concentrations extremely dangerous, and they reverted to their defensive strategy.\n\nThe 27th Infantry Division—which had landed on April 9—took over on the right, along the west coast of Okinawa. General [[John R. Hodge]] now had three divisions in the line, with the 96th in the middle, and the 7th to the east, with each division holding a front of only about {{convert|1.5|mi|km|abbr=on}}. Hodge launched a new offensive of April 19 with a barrage of 324 guns, the largest ever in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Ocean Theater]]. Battleships, cruisers, and destroyers joined the bombardment, which was followed by 650 Navy and Marine planes attacking the enemy positions with [[napalm]], rockets, bombs, and machine guns. The Japanese defenses were sited on [[reverse slope defence|reverse slopes]], where the defenders waited out the artillery barrage and aerial attack in relative safety, emerging from the caves to rain [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] rounds and grenades upon the Americans advancing up the forward slope.\n\nA tank assault to achieve [[breakthrough (military)|breakthrough]] by outflanking Kakazu Ridge failed to link up with its infantry support attempting to cross the ridge and failed with the loss of 22 tanks. Although [[flame tank]]s cleared many cave defenses, there was no breakthrough, and the XXIV Corps suffered 720 casualties. The losses might have been greater, except for the fact that the Japanese had practically all of their infantry reserves tied up farther south, held there by another feint off the Minatoga beaches by the 2nd Marine Division that coincided with the attack.\n\nAt the end of April, after Army forces had pushed through the Machinato defensive line,<ref>West Point Atlas of American Wars</ref> the 1st Marine Division relieved the 27th Infantry Division, and the 77th Infantry Division relieved the 96th. When the 6th Marine Division arrived, the III Amphibious Corps took over the right flank and the 10th Army assumed control of the battle.\n\n[[File:US Flag raised over Shuri castle on Okinawa.jpg|thumb|upright|Lt.

This time, Ushijima attempted to make [[amphibious warfare|amphibious assaults]] on the coasts behind American lines. To support his offensive, the Japanese artillery moved into the open. By doing so, they were able to fire 13,000 rounds in support, but effective American [[counter-battery fire]] destroyed dozens of Japanese artillery pieces. The attack failed.\n\nBuckner launched another American attack on May 11. Ten days of fierce fighting followed. On May 13, troops of the 96th Infantry Division and [[763rd Tank Battalion (United States)|763rd Tank Battalion]] captured Conical Hill. Rising {{convert|476|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the Yonabaru coastal plain, this feature was the eastern anchor of the main Japanese defenses and was defended by about 1,000 Japanese. Meanwhile, on the opposite coast, the 1st and 6th Marine Divisions fought for \"Sugar Loaf Hill\". The capture of these two key positions exposed the Japanese around Shuri on both sides. Buckner hoped to envelop Shuri and trap the main Japanese defending force.\n\nBy the end of May, monsoon rains which had turned contested hills and roads into a morass exacerbated both the [[Military tactics|tactical]] and medical situations. The ground advance began to resemble a [[World War I]] battlefield, as troops became mired in mud, and flooded roads greatly inhibited evacuation of wounded to the rear. Troops lived on a field sodden by rain, part garbage dump and part graveyard. Unburied Japanese and American bodies decayed, sank in the mud, and became part of a noxious stew.

The 32nd Army was able to move nearly 30,000 personnel into its last defense line on the Kiyan Peninsula, which ultimately led to the greatest slaughter on Okinawa in the latter stages of the battle, including the deaths of thousands of civilians. In addition, there were 9,000 IJN troops supported by 1,100 militia, with approximately 4,000 holed up at the underground headquarters on the hillside overlooking the Okinawa Naval Base in the Oroku Peninsula, east of the airfield.\n\nOn June 4, elements of the 6th Marine Division launched an amphibious assault on the peninsula. The 4,000 Japanese sailors, including Admiral [[Minoru Ōta]], all committed suicide within the hand-built tunnels of the underground naval headquarters on June 13. By June 17, the remnants of Ushijima's shattered 32nd Army were pushed into a small pocket in the far south of the island to the southeast of [[Itoman]].\n\nOn June 18, General Buckner was killed by enemy artillery fire while monitoring the forward progress of his troops.

In March 2007, the national [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (MEXT) advised textbook publishers to reword descriptions that the embattled Imperial Japanese Army forced civilians to kill themselves in the war to avoid being taken prisoner. MEXT preferred descriptions that just say that civilians received hand grenades from the Japanese military. This move sparked widespread protests among Okinawans. In June 2007, the [[Okinawa Prefectural Assembly]] adopted a resolution stating, \"We strongly call on the (national) government to retract the instruction and to immediately restore the description in the textbooks so the truth of the Battle of Okinawa will be handed down correctly and a tragic war will never happen again.\"<ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070623a1.html Okinawa slams history text rewrite], ''Japan Times'', June 23, 2007.</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Gheddo |first=Piero |url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Okinawa-against-Tokyo%E2%80%99s-attempts-to-rewrite-history-9666.html |title=JAPAN Okinawa against Tokyo’s attempts to rewrite history - Asia News |publisher=Asianews.it |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn September 29, 2007, about 110,000 people held the biggest [[political rally]] in the history of Okinawa to demand that MEXT retract its order to textbook publishers regarding revising the account of the civilian suicides.

It was fundamental in the early development of [[France in the Middle Ages]] by confirming the French crown's [[sovereignty]] over the [[Angevin Empire|Angevin lands]] of [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]] and [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]].\n\n[[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]] of France defeated an army consisting of [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial German]], English and Flemish soldiers, led by [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor]] in the north. Allied with Philip was [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]], who controlled the southern Holy Roman Empire and afterwards deposed Otto. Other leaders included Count [[Ferdinand, Prince of Portugal|Ferrand of Flanders]], [[William de Longespee, 3rd Earl of Salisbury|William de Longespee]] and [[Renaud de Dammartin|Renaud of Boulogne]]. Ferrand and Renaud were captured and imprisoned and [[John of England|King John of England]] was forced to agree to the [[Magna Carta]] by his discontented barons. Philip was himself able to take undisputed control of most of the territories in France that had belonged to [[John, King of England|King John of England]], Otto's maternal uncle and ally.\n\n==Prelude==\n{{refimprove|section|date=July 2017}}<!--first 2 paragraphs have no citations-->\nIn 1214, [[Ferdinand, Count of Flanders|Ferdinand, Infante of Portugal, and Count of Flanders]] desired the return of the cities of Aire-sur-la-Lys and Saint-Omer, which he had recently lost to [[Philip II of France|Philip II, King of France]] in the Treaty of Pont-à-Vendin. He thus broke allegiance with Philip and assembled a broad coalition including [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto IV]], [[John, King of England|King John I of England]], [[Henry I, Duke of Brabant|Duke Henry I of Brabant]], [[William I, Count of Holland|Count William I of Holland]], [[Theobald I, Duke of Lorraine|Duke Theobald I of Lorraine]], and [[Henry III, Duke of Limburg|Duke Henry III of Limburg]].\n\nThe campaign was planned by John, who was the fulcrum of the alliance; his plan was to draw the French away from Paris southward towards his forces and keep them occupied, while the main army, under Emperor Otto IV, marched on Paris from the north. John's plan was carried out at first, but the allies in the north moved slowly. John, after two encounters with the French, retreated to [[Aquitaine]] on 3 July.\n\nOn 23 July, after having summoned all his [[vassal]]s, Philip had an army consisting of 4,000 cavalry and 11,000 foot soldiers.<ref name=\"BF1\">Batailles française 1214 à 1559 du colonel Hardÿ de Périni</ref> The emperor finally succeeded in concentrating his forces at [[Valenciennes]], although John was out of the picture, and in the interval Philip Augustus had counter marched northward and regrouped. Philip now took the offensive himself, and in maneuvering to get a good cavalry ground upon which to fight he offered battle (27 July), on the plain east of Bouvines and the river Marque.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911 |wstitle=Bouvines |volume=4 |pages=336–337}} This cites:\n* [[Charles Oman]], ''History of the Art of War'', vii. pp. 457–480\n* Kõhler, ''Kriegsgechichte, &c.'', i. 140\n* Delpech, ''Tactique au XIII<sup>e</sup> siècle, 127.</ref> Otto was surprised by the speed of his enemy and was thought to have been caught unprepared by the King of France<ref>[http://bataille.bouvines.free.fr/plans/plangen.php3?np=07 The chroniclers say that Otto also strongly expressed his surprise to find himself facing the French army, while he believed they were on the run.]</ref> (who probably attracted the emperor into this trap<ref>This is the hypothesis of the rhyming chronicles by Philippe Mousket: \"At the approach of night, gathered the council, between him and his barons, For the good king, with his armies (around 21,555) wanted to go to Mortagne. But those of his followers knew not how to advise him. When everyone had said his piece, with the best of intentions, (v.21560) Girard the Sow spoke : \"Sire, will you not go there; Truly, there are difficulties and harshness, and there are also three large villages and two small rivers beyond (v.21565) that prevent us passing to reach this place. But if you return towards your land, and the Flemings, who want war, if you turn back, will say that you flee, (v.21570) And when you follow this path with pride, with confidence, without any order, as all of us want to be Sire, and you, without crown or anger.

For failing to honour these promises, he was excommunicated in 1210 and 1211.</ref> decided to launch an attack on what was then the French rearguard. Philippe Auguste gave battle. His army quickly retreated.\n\nThe Allied army drew up facing south-westward towards Bouvines, the heavy cavalry on the wings, the infantry in one great mass in the center, supported by the cavalry corps under the emperor himself.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> The French army took ground exactly opposite in a similar formation, cavalry on the wings, infantry, including the town militias in the centre, Philip with the cavalry reserve and the royal standard, the [[Oriflamme]], in rear of the men on foot.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Philip's army contained about 2,000 knights (750 were from the [[Crown lands of France|royal demesne]]) and 2,000 mounted [[sergeant]]s with the rest being infantry.<ref name=\"Bradbury283\">J. Bradbury, ''Philip Augustus: King of France 1180–1223'', 283</ref>\n\n==Order of battle==\nEven today, the evaluation of forces is controversial. The classic French historiography often refers to Coalition troops three times more numerous than those of the King of France. [[Philippe Contamine]]<ref>[http://www.aibl.fr/fr/membres/academ/contamine.html The opinion of Philippe Contamine]</ref> is not of this opinion: \"On the face of it, his opponents did not have a clear numerical superiority\". It is said by [[William the Breton]], chaplain to Philip at the Battle of Bouvines, that the lines of soldiers stood in line in a space of 40,000 steps ({{convert|abbr=on|15|ha|disp=or}}),<ref>La Philippide de Guillaume le Breton</ref> which leaves very little clearance and predisposes to hand-to-hand fighting ([[melee]]). William the Breton also says in his column that \"the two lines of combatants were separated by a pretty small space\".\n\nPhilip Augustus had then launched an appeal to the municipalities in northern France, in order to obtain their support.\n\nSeventeen of the thirty-nine municipalities of the [[Crown lands of France|royal demesne]] answered the call for [[militia]]:\n* [[Arras]] sent 1,000 men.\n* [[Abbeville]] region sent 2,000 men.\n* Paris sent a corps of 2,000 men, 1,750 of whom fought on the battlefield.<ref>Dictionary of streets and monuments in Paris and Louis Felix Lazarus 1879 Chapter III Page 13</ref>\n\nIn total, the royal army totalled 7,000 soldiers.\n\nThe royal army was divided into three parts:\n* The right wing, composed of knights of [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] and [[Franche-Comté|Burgundy]], was commanded by the Duke of Burgundy Eudes and his lieutenants: III Gaucher de Châtillon Count of Saint-Pol, Count Wilhelm I of Sancerre, Count of Beaumont and Mathieu de Montmorency and Adam II Viscount of Melun. In the front of the right wing were men of arms and militia from the parishes of Burgundy, Champagne, and [[Picardy (region)|Picardy]] led by mounted sergeants from [[Soissons]].\n* The central battle was conducted by [[Philip Augustus]] and his chief knights – William des Barres, Bartholomew of Roye, Girard Scophe known as \"Girard the Sow\",<ref>Girard Scophe was called the Sow, due to the Latin equivalent of his name: scrofa</ref> William of Garland, [[Enguerrand III de Coucy]] and [[Duke of Nemours|Gautier de Nemours]]. In front of the king and his knights were infantry from the towns of [[Île de France]] and [[Normandy]].\n* The left wing, composed of knights and foot soldiers was led by [[Robert III, Count of Dreux|Robert of Dreux]], and [[William IV, Count of Ponthieu|Count William of Ponthieu]]. The main body of the left wing consisted of Breton police and militia from [[Dreux]], [[Perche]], [[Ponthieu]], and Vimeux.\n\nThe bridge of Bouvines, the only means of retreat across the marshes, was guarded by 150 sergeants at arms of the king who formed the only reserve for the French.\n\nOtto also divided his army into three groups:\n* The left flank, under the command of [[Ferdinand, Prince of Portugal|Ferrand of Flanders]] with his Flemish knights – directed by Arnaud of Oudenaarde. The soldiers were from [[Flanders]] and [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]].\n* The centre under the command of Otto and of [[Theobald I, Duke of Lorraine|Theobald Duke of Lorraine]], [[Henry I, Duke of Brabant|Henry Duke of Brabant]], and [[Philip II, Marquis of Namur|Philip Courtenay Marquis of Namur]]: together with many Saxon soldiers, knights, and infantry from [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and Germany. In front of the centre stood German infantry phalanxes formed deep, bristling with pikes and flanked by companies formed at each corner, then in the second line the Saxon infantry in reserve. Otto stood in between surrounded by 50 German knights.\n* The right flank, under the command of [[Renaud de Dammartin]], included equally Brabant infantry and English knights – under the command of the [[William Longespée, 3rd Earl of Salisbury|Earl of Salisbury William Longespée]].\n\nAt the extreme right, the English archers supported the flank of both the Brabant infantry and the nobles of the two Lorraines.<ref>i.e. [[Duchy of Lorraine]] and [[County of Bar]]</ref>\n\n==Battle==\nThe battle opened with a simultaneous cavalry charge between the French right and the Flemish left.  The French quickly routed the Flemings, who retreated.<ref>Devries, Kelly, Martin Dougherty, Ian Dickie, Phyllis G. Jestice, and Christer Jorgensen. ''Battles of the Medieval World: 1000-1500''. New York: Barnes & Noble, 2006. p. 80-89.</ref> The serious fighting was between the two centers. The infantry of the Low Countries, who were at this time among the best in Europe, drove back the French. Philip led the cavalry reserve of nobles and knights to retrieve the day, and after a long and doubtful fight (in which he himself was unhorsed and narrowly escaped death), began to drive back the Flemings.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, on the French left Robert de Dreux's troops are at first pressed by men led by William Longespée and Renaud de Dammartin are forced to defend the Bouvines bridge foot by foot. William Longespée was unhorsed and taken prisoner by [[Philip of Dreux]], (a.k.a. the fighting [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Beauvais|Bishop of Beauvais]]) and the English soldiers fled. [[Matthieu II of Montmorency|Mathieu de Montmorency]] captured twelve enemy banners (in memory of this feat, the shield of Montmorency includes an additional twelve eagles or sixteen altogether instead of four previously<ref>Gabriel Eysenbach, ''History of Heraldry and the Science of Coats-of-Arms'', 1848, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WPRUAwtJkEoC&hl=fr&pg=PA321#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 321]. (Fr)</ref>).\n\nOn the other wing the French at last routed the Flemish cavalry and captured [[Ferdinand, Count of Flanders]], one of the leaders of the coalition. In the centre the battle was now a melee between the two mounted reserves led by the King and the Emperor in person. Here too the Imperial forces suffered defeat, Otto himself being saved only by the devotion of a handful of Saxon knights.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> The Imperial Eagle Standard was captured by the French.\n\nThe day was already decided in favour of the French when their wings began to close inwards to cut off the retreat of the imperial centre. The battle closed with the celebrated stand of [[Reginald of Boulogne]] (Renaud de Dammartin), a former vassal of King Philip, who formed a ring of seven hundred [[Brabant (duchy)|Brabant]] pikemen, and not only defied every attack of the French cavalry, but himself made repeated charges or sorties with his small force of knights. Eventually, and long after the Imperial army had begun its retreat, the gallant [[Sheltron|schiltrom]] formation was ridden down and annihilated by a charge of three thousand men-at-arms. Reginald was taken prisoner in the melee. The prisoners also included two other counts, Hainaut Ferrand and [[William Longespée, 3rd Earl of Salisbury|William Longespée]], twenty-five barons and over a hundred knights. The death toll amounted to about 170 knights of the defeated party, and many thousands of foot soldiers on either side.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nAccording to Jean Favier, Bouvines is \"one of the most decisive and symbolic battles in the history of France\".<ref>''Dictionnaire de la France médiévale'', Paris, Fayard, 1993, p. 176</ref> For Philippe Contamine, \"the battle of Bouvines had both important consequences and a great impact\".<ref>''Histoire militaire de la France'' (tome 1, des origines à 1715), Paris, PUF, 1992, p. 83</ref>\n\nPhilip returned to [[Paris]] triumphant, marching his captive prisoners behind him in a long procession, as his grateful subjects came out to greet the victorious king. In the aftermath of the battle, Otto retreated to his castle of [[Harzburg]] and was soon overthrown as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], who had already been recognized as emperor in the south a year and a half prior. Count Ferdinand remained imprisoned following his defeat, while King John obtained a five-year truce, on very lenient terms given the circumstances.\n\nPhilip's decisive victory was crucial in ordering politics in both England and France. In the former, so weakened was the defeated King [[John of England]] that he soon needed to submit to his barons' demands and agree to the [[Magna Carta]], limiting the power of the crown and establishing the basis for common law.<ref name=\"Halfond2015\">{{cite book|last=Halfond|first=Gregory I|title=The Medieval Way of War: Studies in Medieval Military History in Honor of Bernard S.

Octavian's fleet was commanded by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]], while Antony's fleet was supported by the power of Queen Cleopatra of [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]].\n\nOctavian's victory enabled him to consolidate his power over Rome and its dominions. He adopted the title of [[Princeps]] (\"first citizen\") and some years later was awarded the title of [[Augustus#First settlement|Augustus]] (\"revered\") by the Roman Senate. This became the name by which he was known in later times. As Augustus, he retained the trappings of a restored Republican leader, but historians generally view this consolidation of power and the adoption of these honorifics as the end of the [[Roman Republic]] and the beginning of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=100 decisive battles: From ancient times to the present|last=Davis|first=Paul K.|date=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|isbn=9780195143669|location=New York|pages=63|oclc=45102987}}</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\nThe alliance between [[Augustus|Octavian]], [[Mark Antony]], and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Lepidus]], commonly known as the [[Second Triumvirate]], was renewed for a five-year term in 38 BC. However, the triumvirate broke down when Octavian saw [[Caesarion]], the professed son of [[Julius Caesar]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Roller|first=Duane W.|title=Cleopatra: A Biography|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=US|pages=70–73}}</ref> and Queen [[Cleopatra|Cleopatra VII]] of Egypt, as a major threat to his power.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} This occurred when [[Mark Antony]], the other most influential member of the triumvirate, abandoned his wife, Octavian's sister [[Octavia the Younger|Octavia Minor]]. Afterwards he moved to Egypt to start a long-term romance with Cleopatra, becoming the de facto stepfather to Caesarion. Such an affair was doomed to become a political scandal.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Antony was inevitably perceived by Octavian and the majority of the Roman Senate as the leader of a separatist movement that threatened to break the unity of the Roman Republic.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n[[File:Ballistae on roman ship.JPG|thumb|right|300px|[[Ballista]]e on a Roman ship]]\n\nOctavian's prestige and, more importantly, the loyalty of his legions, had been initially boosted by Julius Caesar's legacy of 44 BC, by which 19-year-old Octavian was officially adopted as Caesar's only son and the sole legitimate heir of his enormous wealth. Antony had been the most important and most successful senior officer in Caesar's army (''[[Master of the Horse#Magister Equitum (Ancient Rome)|magister equitum]]'') and, thanks to his military record, claimed a substantial share of the political support of Caesar's soldiers and veterans. Both Octavian and Antony had fought against their common enemies in the civil war that followed the assassination of Caesar.\n\nAfter years of loyal cooperation with Octavian, Antony started to act independently, eventually raising his rival's suspicion that he was vying to become sole master of Rome. When he left Octavia Minor and moved to [[Alexandria]] to become Cleopatra's official partner, he led many Roman politicians to believe that he was trying to become the unchecked ruler of Egypt and of other eastern kingdoms, while still maintaining his command over the many Roman legions in the East.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} As a personal challenge to Octavian's prestige, Antony tried to get Caesarion accepted as a true heir of Caesar, even though the legacy did not mention him. Antony and Cleopatra formally elevated Caesarion, then 13, to power in 34 BC, giving him the vague but alarming title of [[King of Kings|\"King of the Kings\"]] ([[Donations of Alexandria]]).{{sfn|David|David|2002|page=35}}{{sfn|Kebric|2005|page=109}} Being a son of Caesar, such an entitlement was felt as a threat to Roman republican traditions.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} According to a widespread belief, Antony had once offered a [[diadem]] to Caesar.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Thereafter, Octavian started a propaganda war, denouncing Antony as an enemy of Rome, asserting that he was seeking to establish a personal monarchy over the entire Roman Empire on the behalf of Caesarion, circumventing the Roman Senate.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} It was also said that Antony intended to move the capital of the empire to Alexandria.{{sfn|Potter|2009|page=161}}{{sfn|Scullard|2013|page=150}}\n\nAs the Second Triumvirate formally expired on the last day of 33 BC, Antony wrote to the Senate that he did not wish to be reappointed. He hoped that he might be regarded by them as their champion against the ambition of Octavian, whom he presumed would not be willing to abandon his position in a similar manner.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The causes of mutual dissatisfaction between the two had been continually accumulating. Antony complained that Octavian had exceeded his powers in deposing [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]], in taking over the countries held by [[Sextus Pompeius]], and in enlisting soldiers for himself without sending half to him. Octavian complained that Antony had no authority for being in Egypt; that his execution of Sextus Pompeius was illegal; that his treachery to the [[king of Armenia]] disgraced the Roman name; that he had not sent half the proceeds of the spoils to Rome according to his agreement; and that his connection with Cleopatra and the acknowledgment of Caesarion as a legitimate son of Caesar were a degradation of his office and a menace to himself.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=775-779}}\n\nDuring 32 BC, a third of the Senate and both [[consul]]s allied with Antony. The consuls had determined to conceal the extent of Antony's demands. [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 32 BC)|Gnaeus Ahenobarbus]] seems to have wished to keep quiet, but [[Gaius Sosius]] on 1 January made an elaborate speech in favor of Antony, and would have proposed the confirmation of his act had it not been vetoed by a tribune. Octavian was not present, but at the next meeting made a reply of such a nature that the consuls both left Rome to join Antony; Antony, when he heard of it, after publicly divorcing Octavia, came at once to [[Ephesus]] with Cleopatra, where a vast fleet was gathered from all parts of the East, of which Cleopatra furnished a large proportion.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=775-779}} After staying with his allies at Samos, Antony moved to Athens. His land forces, which had been in Armenia, came down to the coast of Asia, and embarked under L. Canidius Crassus.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=780-784}}\n\nOctavian was not behind in his strategic preparations. Military operations began in 31 BC, when Octavian's general [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] captured [[Methoni, Messenia|Methone]], a Greek town allied to Antony. However, by the publication of Antony's will, which had been put into his hands by the traitor [[Plancus]], and by carefully letting it be known in Rome what preparations were going on at [[Samos]] and how entirely Antony was acting as the agent of Cleopatra, Octavian produced such a violent outburst of feeling that he easily obtained Antony's deposition from the consulship of 31 BC, for which Antony had been designated. In addition to the deposition Octavian procured a vote for a proclamation of war against Cleopatra – well understood to mean against Antony, though he was not named.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=780-784}} In doing this, the Senate issued a war declaration and deprived Antony of any legal authority.\n\n==Battle==\nAntony meant to anticipate an attack by a descent upon Italy towards the end of 32 BC, and went as far as [[Corcyra]]. But finding the sea guarded by a squadron of Octavian's ships, he retired to winter at [[Patrae]] while his fleet for the most part lay in the [[Ambracian Gulf]], and his land forces encamped near the promontory of Actium, while the opposite side of the narrow strait into the Ambracian Gulf was protected by a tower and troops.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=780-784}}\n\nAfter Octavian's proposals for a conference with Antony had been scornfully rejected, both sides prepared for the struggle the next year. The early months passed without notable event, beyond some successes of Agrippa on the coasts of Greece, meant to divert Antony's attention. It was not until the latter part of August that troops were landed in the neighborhood of Antony's camp on the north side of the strait. Still Antony could not be tempted out. It took some months for his full strength to arrive from the various places in which his allies or his ships had wintered, and during these months not only was Agrippa continuing his descent upon Greek towns and coasts, but in various cavalry skirmishes Octavian had so far prevailed that Antony abandoned the north side of the strait and confined his soldiers to the southern camp. Cleopatra now earnestly advised that garrisons should be put into strong towns, and that the main fleet should return to Alexandria. The large contingent furnished by Egypt gave her advice as much weight as her personal influence over Antony, and it appears that this movement was agreed.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=780-784}}\n\nOctavian learned of this and debated how to prevent it. At first of a mind to let Antony sail and then attack him, he was prevailed upon by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] to give battle.<ref>[[Dio Cassius]] 50:31 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/50*.html#31]</ref> On 1 September he issued an address to his fleet, preparing them for battle. The next day was wet and the sea was rough. When the trumpet signal for the start rang out, Antony's fleet began issuing from the straits, and the ships moved into line and remained quiet. Octavian, after a short hesitation, ordered his vessels to steer to the right and pass the enemy's ships. For fear of being surrounded, Antony was forced to give the word to attack.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=780-784}}\n\n===Order of battle===\n[[File:Battle of Actium-en.svg|thumb|right|300px|Order of battle]]\n\nThe two fleets met outside the [[Gulf of Actium]] (today [[Preveza]]), on the morning of 2 September 31 BC. Antony's fleet numbered 500,{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=780-784}} of which 230 were large [[warship|war galleys]] with towers full of armed men. He led these through the straits towards the open sea. Octavian had about 250 warships.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=780-784}} Octavian's fleet was waiting beyond the straits, led by the experienced admiral Agrippa, commanding from the left wing of the fleet, [[Lucius Arruntius]] the centre<ref name=\"65-66\">[[Plutarch]], ''Antony'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Antony*.html#65 65–66;]</ref> and [[Marcus Lurius]] the right.<ref name=\"ii.85\">[[Velleius Paterculus]], ''History of Rome'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2C*.html#85 ii.85.]</ref> [[Titus Statilius Taurus]]<ref name=\"ii.85\"/> commanded Octavian's armies, who observed the battle from shore to the north of the straits. Antony and [[Lucius Gellius Publicola (consul 36 BC)|Gellius Publicola]] commanded the right wing of the Antonian fleet, while Marcus Octavius and Marcus Insteius commanded the center,<ref name=\"65-66\"/> with Cleopatra's squadron positioned behind them. [[Gaius Sosius]] launched the initial attack from the left wing of the fleet, while Antony's chief lieutenant [[Publius Canidius Crassus]] was in command of the triumvir's land forces.<ref name=\"ii.85\"/>\n\n===Combat===\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2016}}\n\nIt is estimated that Antony had around 140 ships, vs 260 ships of Octavian's fleet. What Antony lacked in quantity was made up for in quality (of vessel), as his ships were mainly the standard Roman warship, [[quinquereme]]s with smaller [[quadrireme]]s, heavier and wider than Octavian's and making them ideal weapon platforms.<ref>Plutarch, The Life of Antony, 61</ref> Antony's personal flag ship, like those of his admirals, was a \"ten\". An \"eight\" war galley had around 200 heavy marines, archers, and at least 6 ballista catapults. Being larger than Octavian's ships, Antony's war galleys were very difficult to board in close combat, and were able to rain down missiles onto their smaller and lower opponent's ships. The bows of the galleys were armored with [[bronze]] plates and square-cut timbers, making a successful ramming attack with similar equipment difficult. The only way to disable such a ship was to smash its oars, rendering it immobile and hopefully, isolated from the rest of its fleet. The main weakness of Antony's ships was their lack of maneuverability; such a ship, once isolated from support of its fleet, could be swamped with boarding attacks. However many of his ships were undermanned with rowing crews; there had been a severe malaria outbreak while they were waiting for Octavian's fleet to arrive.<ref>[[Dio Cassius]] 50:13 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/50*.html#13]</ref>\n\nOctavian's fleet was largely made up of smaller \"[[Liburna|Liburnian]]\" vessels.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=780-784}} Octavian's ships, although smaller, were still manageable in the heavy surf and could out-manoeuvre Antony's ships, get in close, attack the above-deck crew with a shower of arrows and ballista-launched stones, and then retreat.<ref>Dio, Roman History 50.32</ref> Moreover, his crews were better-trained, professional, well fed and rested.\nA medium ballista was capable of penetrating the sides of most warships at close range and had an effective range of around 200 yards. Most ballista firing was aimed at the marines on the fighting decks of the ships.\n\nBefore the battle one of Antony's generals, [[Quintus Dellius]], had defected to Octavian, bringing with him Antony's battle plans.<ref>Cassius Dio, Roman History [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/50*.html#23 50.23.1–3]</ref>\n\nShortly after midday, Antony was forced to extend his line from the protection of the shore and finally engage the enemy. Seeing this Octavian's fleet put to sea. Antony had hoped to use his biggest ships to drive back Agrippa's wing on the north end of his line, but Octavian's entire fleet, aware of this strategy, stayed out of range. By about noon the fleets were in formation but Octavian refused to be drawn out so Antony was forced to attack. The battle raged all afternoon without decisive result.\n\nCleopatra's fleet, in the rear, retreated to the open sea without engaging. A breeze sprang up in the right direction, and the Egyptian ships were soon hurrying out of sight.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=780-784}}\n\nAntony had not observed the signal, and believing that it was mere panic and all was lost, followed the flying squadron. The contagion spread fast; everywhere sails were seen unfurling, and towers and other heavy fighting gear going by the board. Some fought on, and it was not until long after nightfall, when many a ship was blazing from the firebrands thrown upon them, that the work was done.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=780-784}} Making the best of the situation, he burned those ships he could no longer man, while clustering the remainder tightly together. With many oarsmen dead or unfit to serve, the powerful, head-on ramming tactic for which the Octaries had been designed was now impossible. Antony transferred to a smaller vessel with his flag and managed to escape, taking a few ships with him as an escort to help break through Octavian's lines. Those left behind were captured or sunk.\n\nA differing account of the battle is argued by J.M. Carter. He postulates that Antony knew he was surrounded and had nowhere to run. To try to turn this to his advantage, Antony gathered his ships around him in a quasi-horseshoe formation, staying close to the shore for safety. Then, should Octavian's ships approach Antony's, the sea would push them into the shore. Antony foresaw that he would not be able to defeat Octavian's forces, so he and Cleopatra stayed in the rear of the formation. Eventually, Antony sent the ships on the northern part of the formation to attack. He had them move out to the north, spreading out Octavian's ships which up until now were tightly arranged. He sent [[Gaius Sosius]] down to the south to spread the remaining ships out to the south. This left a hole in the middle of Octavian's formation. Antony seized the opportunity and with Cleopatra on her ship and him on a different ship, sped through the gap and escaped, abandoning his entire force.\n\nWith the end of the battle, Octavian exerted himself to save the crews of the burning vessels, and had to spend the whole night on board. On the next day, as much of the land army as had not escaped to their own lands submitted or were followed in their retreat to Macedonia and forced to surrender, and Antony's camp was occupied, bringing an end to the war.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=780-784}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe political consequences were far-reaching. Under cover of darkness some 19 legions and 12,000 [[cavalry]] fled before Antony was able to engage Octavian in a land battle. Thus, after Antony lost his fleet, his army, which had been equal to that of Octavian, deserted. Antony, though he had not laid down his imperium, was a fugitive and a rebel without that shadow of a legal position which the presence of the consuls and senators had given him in the previous year. Some of the victorious fleet went in pursuit of him; but Octavian himself visited Greece and Asia, and spent the winter at Samos; though he was obliged to go for a short time to Brundisium to settle a mutiny and arrange for assignations of land.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=780-784}}\n\nAt [[Samos]], Octavian received a message from [[Cleopatra]] with the present of a gold crown and throne, offering to abdicate in favor of her sons. She was allowed to believe that she would be well treated, for Octavian was anxious to secure her for his triumph. Antony, who had found himself generally deserted, after vainly attempting to secure the army stationed near Paraetonium under Pinarius and sending his eldest son [[Marcus Antonius Antyllus|Antyllus]] with money to Octavian and an offer to live at Athens as a private citizen, found himself in the spring attacked on two sides. [[Cornelius Gallus|C. Cornelius Gallus]] was advancing from Paraetonium; and Octavian landed at Pelusium, with the connivance it was believed of Cleopatra. Antony was defeated by Gallus, and returning to Egypt, advanced on Pelusium.\n\nDespite a victory at [[Alexandria]] on 31 July 30 BC, more of Antony's men deserted, leaving him with insufficient forces to fight Octavian. A slight success over Octavian's tired soldiers encouraged him to make a general attack, in which he was decisively beaten. Failing to escape on board a ship, he stabbed himself upon mistakenly believing that Cleopatra had already died.<ref name=\"pp. 311-312\">[[Plutarch]], ''Antony'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Antony*.html#76 pp. 311-312;]</ref> He did not die at once, and when he found out that Cleopatra was still alive, he insisted on being taken to the mausoleum in which Cleopatra was hiding, and died in her arms. She was shortly afterwards brought to the palace and vainly attempted to move Octavian to pity.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=780-784}}\n\nCleopatra committed suicide, on 12 August 30 BC. In one account, she put an end to her life by the bite of an [[asp (reptile)|asp]] conveyed to her in a basket of figs.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=780-784}} Octavian had [[Caesarion]] killed later that month, finally securing his legacy as Caesar's only 'son'.\n\nOctavian's victory at [[Actium]] gave him sole and uncontested control of \"Mare Nostrum\" (Our Sea, i.e., the Roman Mediterranean) and he became \"Augustus Caesar\" and the \"first citizen\" of Rome. This victory, consolidating his power over every Roman institution, marked the transition of Rome from Republic to Empire. Egypt's surrender following Cleopatra's death marked the final demise of both the [[Hellenistic Period]] and the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]].<ref>[http://www.vizin.org/projects/actium/html/actiumsol.htm Actium – the solution] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306120845/http://www.vizin.org/projects/actium/html/actiumsol.htm |date=March 6, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]''\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|last=Carter|first=John M. |title=The Battle of Actium: The Rise & Triumph of Augustus Caesar|publisher=Hamilton\n|year= 1970|ISBN= 0241015162|oclc= 77602}}\n* {{Cite book |last1=David |first1=Rosalie |last2 = David | first2 = Anthony E. |title=A Biographical Dictionary of Ancient Egypt |year=2002 |publisher=Routledge |isbn= 978-1135377045 | ref = harv}}\n* {{Citation |last=Everitt |first=Anthony |title=Augustus: The Life of Rome's First Emperor |year=2006 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=1-4000-6128-8 }}\n* {{Cite book |last=Kebric |first=Robert B. | title=Roman People |year=2005 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn= 978-0072869040 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book | last = Potter | first = D.

This climactic battle of the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]], was a decisive defeat for Italy and secured Ethiopian sovereignty.\n\nAs the 20th century approached, Africa had been carved up among the European powers at the [[Berlin Conference]]. The two independent exceptions were the  [[Liberia|Republic of Liberia]] on the west coast and Ethiopia, or then still commonly known as Abyssinia, in the eastern Horn of Africa region. The newly unified [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] was a relative newcomer to the imperialist [[scramble for Africa]]. Italy had two recently obtained African territories: [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somalia]]. Both were near Ethiopia on the Horn of Africa. Italy sought to improve its position in Africa by conquering Ethiopia and joining it with its two territories. Menelik II as the contemporary Ethiopian leader pitted Italy against its European rivals while stockpiling weapons to defend Ethiopia against the Italians.\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1889, the Italians signed the [[Treaty of Wuchale]] with then ''[[Negus]]''{{#tag:ref|Roughly equivalent to [[King]].|group=nb}} [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelik]] of [[Shewa]]. The treaty ceded territories previously part of Ethiopia, namely the provinces of [[Bogos]], [[Hamasien]], [[Akkele Guzay]], [[Serae]], and parts of [[Tigray Province|Tigray]]. In return, Italy promised Menelik the second's rule, financial assistance and military supplies. A dispute later arose over the interpretation of the two versions of the document. The Italian-language version of the disputed Article 17 of the treaty stated that the Emperor of Ethiopia was obliged to conduct all foreign affairs through Italian authorities. This would in effect make Ethiopia a [[protectorate]] of the Kingdom of Italy. The [[Amharic]] version of the article however stated that the Emperor could use the good offices of the Kingdom of Italy in his relations with foreign nations if he wished. However, the Italian diplomats claimed that the original Amharic text included the clause and that Menelik II knowingly signed a modified copy of the Treaty.<ref>{{cite web | author=Piero Pastoretto | title=Battaglia di Adua | url=http://www.arsmilitaris.org/pubblicazioni/ADUA/adua.htm | accessdate=2006-06-04 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060531223251/http://www.arsmilitaris.org/pubblicazioni/ADUA/adua.htm |archivedate=31 May 2006 |language=it}}</ref>\n\nThe Italian government decided on a military solution to force Ethiopia to abide by the Italian version of the treaty.  As a result, Italy and Ethiopia faced off in what was later to be known as the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]]. In December 1894, [[Bahta Hagos]] led a rebellion against the Italians in [[Akkele Guzay]], in what was then Italian controlled [[Eritrea]]. Units of General [[Oreste Baratieri]]'s army under Major {{Interlanguage link multi|Pietro Toselli|it}} crushed the rebellion and killed Bahta. The Italian army then occupied the [[Tigray Province|Tigrayan]] capital, [[Adwa]]. In January 1895, Baratieri's army went on to defeat [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles#Men's honorifics|Ras]] [[Mengesha Yohannes]] in the [[Battle of Coatit]], forcing Mengesha to retreat further south.\n\nBy late 1895, Italian forces had advanced deep into Ethiopian territory. On 7 December 1895, ''[[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles#Men's honorifics|Ras]]''{{#tag:ref|Roughly equivalent to [[Duke]].|group=nb}} [[Ras Makonnen|Makonnen]], ''Ras'' [[Welle Betul]] and ''Ras'' [[Mengesha Yohannes]] commanding a larger Ethiopian group of Menelik's vanguard annihilated a small Italian unit at the [[Battle of Amba Alagi (1895)|Battle of Amba Alagi]]. The Italians were then forced to withdraw to more defensible positions in [[Tigray Province|Tigray]], where the two main armies faced each other. By late February 1896, supplies on both sides were running low. General [[Oreste Baratieri]], commander of the Italian forces, knew the Ethiopian forces had been living off the land, and once the supplies of the local peasants were exhausted, Emperor [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelik]] the second's army would begin to melt away. However, the Italian government insisted that General Baratieri act.\n\nOn the evening of 29 February, Baratieri, about to be replaced by a new governor, General Baldissera,  met with his [[Brigadier General|brigadiers]] [[Matteo Albertone]], [[Giuseppe Arimondi]], [[Vittorio Dabormida]], and [[Giuseppe Ellena]], concerning their next steps. He opened the meeting on a negative note,  revealing to his brigadiers that provisions would be exhausted in less than five days, and suggested retreating, perhaps as far back as [[Asmara]]. His subordinates argued forcefully for an attack, insisting that to retreat at this point would only worsen the poor morale.<ref>Harold G. Marcus, ''The Life and Times of Menelik II: Ethiopia 1844–1913'', 1975 (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1995), p. 170</ref> Dabormida exclaiming, \"Italy would prefer the loss of two or three thousand men to a dishonorable retreat.\" Baratieri delayed making a decision for a few more hours, claiming that he needed to wait for some last-minute intelligence, but in the end announced that the attack would start the next morning at 9:00.<ref>David Levering Lewis, ''The Race for Fashoda'' (New York: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1987), p. 116. {{ISBN|1-55584-058-2}}</ref> His troops began their march to their starting positions shortly after midnight.\n\n==Forces assembled==\nThe Italian army comprised four [[brigade]]s totaling 17,978 troops, with fifty-six artillery pieces.<ref>Lewis, ''Fashoda'', pp. 116f. He breaks down their numbers into 10,596 Italian officers and soldiers and 7,104 Eritrean askaris.</ref>  However, it is likely that fewer fought in the actual battle on the Italian side: Harold Marcus notes that \"several thousand\" soldiers were needed in support roles and to guard the lines of communication to the rear. He accordingly estimates that the Italian force at Adwa consisted of 14,923 effectives.<ref>Marcus, ''Menelik II'', p. 173</ref> One brigade under General Albertone was made up of [[Eritrea]]n [[askari]] led by Italian officers.<ref>Thomas Pakenham, p. 481 ''The Scramble for Africa'', {{ISBN|0-349-10449-2}}</ref> The remaining three brigades were Italian units under Brigadiers Dabormida, Ellena and Arimondi. While these included elite [[Bersaglieri]] and [[Alpini]] units, a large proportion of the troops were inexperienced conscripts recently drafted from metropolitan regiments in Italy into newly formed \"d'Africa\" [[battalion]]s for service in Africa. Additionally a limited number of troops were drafted from the  [[Cacciatori d'Africa]] units of local Italian settlers.<ref name = \"Berkley 1901\">George Fitz-Hardinge Berkley ''The Campaign of Adowa and the rise of Menelik'', London: Constable 1901.</ref><ref>Raffaele Ruggeri, p. 82 ''Le Guerre Coloniali Italiane 1885/1900'', Editrice Militare Italiana 1988</ref>\n\nAs Chris Prouty describes:\n\n{{quote|They [the Italians] had inadequate maps, old-model guns, poor communication equipment and inferior footgear for the rocky ground. (The newer [[Carcano]] Model 91 rifles were not issued because Baratieri, under constraints to be economical, wanted to use up the old cartridges.)

The supporting crossfire each column could give the others made the 'soldiers as deadly as razored shears'. Albertone's brigade was to set the pace for the others. He was to position himself on the summit known as [[Kidane Mehret]], which would give the Italians the high ground from which to meet the Ethiopians.<ref name=\"Lewis-117\"/>}} However, the three leading Italian brigades had become separated during their overnight march and at dawn were spread across several miles of very difficult terrain.

Arimondi's brigade beat back the Ethiopians who repeatedly charged the Italian position for three hours with gradually fading strength until Menelik released his reserve of 25,000 [[Shewa]]ns and swamped the Italian defenders. Two [[Company (military unit)|companies]] of Bersaglieri who arrived at the same moment could not help and were cut down.\n\nDabormida's Italian Brigade had moved to support Albertone but was unable to reach him in time. Cut off from the remainder of the Italian Army, Dabormida began a fighting retreat towards friendly positions. However, he inadvertently marched his command into a narrow valley where the Oromo cavalry under Ras Mikael slaughtered his brigade, while shouting ''Ebalgume! Ebalgume!'' (\"Reap! Reap!\"). Dabormida's remains were never found, although his brother learned from an old woman living in the area that she had given water to a mortally wounded Italian officer, \"a chief, a great man with spectacles and a watch, and golden stars\".<ref>George Fitz-Hardinge Berkeley, ''Campaign of Adowa'' (1902), quoted in Lewis, ''Fashoda'', p. 118.</ref>\n\nThe remaining two brigades under Baratieri himself were outflanked and destroyed piecemeal on the slopes of [[Mount Belah]]. Menelik watched as [[Gojjam]] forces under the command of [[Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam|Tekle Haymonot]] made quick work of the last intact Italian brigade. By noon, the survivors of the Italian army were in full retreat and the battle was over.\n\n== Immediate aftermath ==\nThe Italians suffered about 7,000 killed and 1,500 wounded in the battle and subsequent retreat back into Eritrea, with 3,000 taken prisoner. Brigadiers Dabormida and Arimondi were amongst the dead. Ethiopian losses have been estimated at around 4,000–5,000 killed and 8,000 wounded.<ref name=\"Uhlig-109\"/><ref name = \"Pankhurst-1998\">[[Richard K. P. Pankhurst|Pankhurst]].

In Rome, to prevent these violent protests, the universities and theatres were closed. Police were called out to disperse rock-throwers in front of Prime Minister Crispi's residence. Crispi resigned on 9 March. Troops were called out to quell demonstrations in Naples. In Pavia, crowds built barricades on the railroad tracks to prevent a troop train from leaving the station.  The Association of Women of Rome, Turin, Milan and Pavia called for the return of all military forces in Africa. Funeral masses were intoned for the known and unknown dead. Families began sending to the newspapers letters they had received before Adwa in which their menfolk described their poor living conditions and their fears at the size of the army they were going to face. King Umberto declared his birthday (14 March) a day of mourning. Italian communities in [[St. Petersburg]], [[London]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Chicago]], [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Jerusalem]] collected money for the families of the dead and for the Italian Red Cross.''<ref>Prouty, ''Empress Taytu'', pp. 159f.</ref>}}\n\nThe Russian support for Ethiopia led to the advent of a Russian Red Cross mission. The Russian mission was a military mission conceived as a medical support for the Ethiopian troops. It arrived in Addis Ababa some three months after Menelik's Adwa victory.<ref>[http://www.linkethiopia.org/guide/pankhurst/medicine/medicine_6.html The Russian Red Cross Mission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003141829/http://www.linkethiopia.org/guide/pankhurst/medicine/medicine_6.html |date=3 October 2011 }}</ref>\n\n== Follow-up to Ethiopian victory ==\n[[File:Baratieri.jpg|thumb|middle|200px|General [[Oreste Baratieri]]]]\nEmperor Menelik decided not to follow up on his victory by attempting to drive the routed Italians out of their colony. The victorious Emperor limited his demands to little more than the abrogation of the [[Treaty of Wuchale]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} In the context of the prevailing balance of power, the emperor's crucial goal was to preserve Ethiopian independence. In addition, Ethiopia had just begun to emerge from a long and brutal [[Famines in Ethiopia|famine]]; Harold Marcus reminds us that the army was restive over its long service in the field, short of rations, and the short rains which would bring all travel to a crawl would soon start to fall.<ref>Marcus, ''Menelik II'', p. 176.</ref> At the time, Menelik claimed a shortage of cavalry horses with which to harry the fleeing soldiers. Chris Prouty observes that \"a failure of nerve on the part of Menelik has been alleged by both Italian and Ethiopian sources.\"<ref>Prouty, ''Empress Taytu'', p. 161.</ref> Lewis believes that it \"was his farsighted certainty that total annihilation of Baratieri and a sweep into Eritrea would force the Italian people to turn a bungled colonial war into a national crusade\"<ref>Lewis, ''Fashoda'', p. 120.</ref> that stayed his hand.\n\nAs a direct result of the battle, Italy signed the [[Treaty of Addis Ababa]], recognizing Ethiopia as an independent state. Almost forty years later, on 3 October 1935, after the [[League of Nations]]'s weak response to the [[Abyssinia Crisis]], the Italians launched a new military campaign endorsed by [[Benito Mussolini]], the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]]. This time the Italians employed vastly superior military technology such as tanks and aircraft, as well as [[chemical warfare]], and the Ethiopian forces were defeated by May 1936. Following the war, Italy occupied Ethiopia for five years (1936–41), before eventually being driven out during World War II by [[British Empire]] and Ethiopian ''Arbegnoch'' (patriot)<ref>{{cite book|first=A.D.|last=Roberts|page=740|title=The Cambridge History of Africa Vol 7|ISBN=0-521-22505-1}}</ref> forces.\n\n== Significance ==\n\"The confrontation between Italy and Ethiopia at Adwa was a fundamental turning point in Ethiopian history,\" writes Henze.<ref>Henze, ''Layers of Layers of Time'', p.180.</ref> On a similar note, the Ethiopian historian [[Bahru Zewde]] observed that \"few events in the modern period have brought Ethiopia to the attention of the world as has the victory at Adwa\".<ref>Bahru Zewde, ''A History of Modern Ethiopia'' (London: James Currey, 1991), p. 81.</ref>\n[[File:Two Italian soldiers survivors Battle of Adua.jpg|thumb|200px|Two [[Italian diaspora|Italian]] soldiers captured and held captive after the Battle of Adwa.]]\nThe [[Russian Empire]] had sold some artillery pieces to the Ethiopian forces and paid enthusiastic compliments to the Ethiopian success.

One student of Ethiopia, Donald N. Levine, points out that for the Italians Adwa \"became a national trauma which demagogic leaders strove to avenge. It also played no little part in motivating Italy's revanchist adventure in 1935\". Levine also noted that the victory \"gave encouragement to isolationist and conservative strains that were deeply rooted in Ethiopian culture, strengthening the hand of those who would strive to keep Ethiopia from adopting techniques imported from the modern West – resistances with which both Menelik and Ras Teferi/[[Haile Selassie]] would have to contend\".<ref>[http://www.ethiopianreview.com/content/2009/03/the-battle-of-adwa-as-a-historic-event/ \"The Battle of Adwa as a 'Historic' Event\"], ''[[Ethiopian Review]]'', 3 March 2009 (Retrieved 9 March 2009)</ref>\n\n== Contemporary celebrations of Adwa ==\n===Public holiday===\n\nThe victory of [[Adwa]], which is officially celebrated across Ethiopia on the 1st of March every year, marks the momentous victory that [[Ethiopia]] achieved against the invading [[Italian army]] on March 1, 1896. Most historians agree that the Battle of Adwa is the first inter-state conflict of its kind where an African army has definitively defeated a European army. Ethiopia’s decisive victory at the Battle of Adwa has inspired several [[Africa]]n countries in their fight against [[European colonialism]]. During the 121 years anniversary of [[Adwa]], Ethiopian academic and [[social media]] contributor Wondwesen Tafesse posted a message on [[Facebook]] that reads, “Most nations have independence day, we [Ethiopians] have victory day. And, we call it…A D W A”.<ref>Wondwosen TE – most nations have independence day, we have.. (2017) Available at: https://www.facebook.com/wondwesen/posts/10155081782689324?hc_location=ufi (Accessed: 5 March 2017).</ref> This message resonated with the Ethiopian social media community, and has since been shared, retweeted and posted on different social media networking sites thousands of times. The message has inspired Ethiopians, and served as a motto during the 121st celebration of the Victory of Adwa on social media.\n\nThe Victory of [[Adwa]] is a public holiday in all regional states and [[charter cities]] across Ethiopia. All schools, banks, post offices and government offices are closed, with the exceptions of health facilities. Some taxi services and public transports choose not to operate on this day. Shops are normally open but most close earlier than usual.\n\n===Public celebrations===\nThe Victory of Adwa, being a [[public holiday]], is commemorated in public spaces. In [[Addis Ababa]], the Victory of Adwa is celebrated at [[Menelik Square]] with the presence of government officials, patriots, foreign diplomats and the general public. Ethiopian Police Orchestra play various patriotic songs as they walk around Menelik Square.\n\nThe public dress up in traditional Ethiopian patriotic attire. Men often wear [[Jodhpurs]] pants, various types of vest tops, and carry the Ethiopian flag, various patriotic banners and placards, and traditional Ethiopian shields and swords called [[Shotel]]. Women dress up in different patterns of handcrafted traditional [[Ethiopian clothing]], known in [[Amharic]] as [[Habesha kemis]]. Some wear black gowns on top, while others put royal crowns on their head. Women’s dressing style, like their male counterparts, imitate the traditional style of Ethiopian patriotic women. Of particular note is the dominant presence of Empress [[Taytu Betul]] during these celebrations.\n\nEmpress [[Taytu Betul]] is the beloved and influential wife of Emperor [[Menelik II]], who played a significant role during the Battle of Adwa. Although often overlooked, thousands of women fought during the Battle of Adwa alongside men. Some were trained as nurses to attend to the wounded, while others mainly cooked and supplied food and water to the soldiers and comforted the wounded.\n\nIn addition to [[Addis Ababa]], other major cities in Ethiopia, including [[Bahir Dar]], [[Debre Markos]] and the town of [[Adwa]] itself, where the Battle of Adwa took place, celebrate the Victory of Adwa in public ceremonies.\n\n===Symbols===\nSeveral images and symbols are used during the commemoration of the Victory of Adwa, including the tri-coloured Green, Gold and Red Ethiopian flag, images of [[Emperor]] [[Menelik II]] and [[Empress]] [[Taytu Betul]], as well as other prominent kings and war generals of the time including [[King]] [[Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam]], [[Michael of Wollo|King Michael]] of [[Wollo]], [[Dejazmach]] [[Balcha Safo]], [[Fitawrari]] [[Habte Giyorgis Dinagde]], and [[Fitawrari]] [[Gebeyehu]], among others. Surviving members of the Ethiopian patriotic battalions wear the various medals that they collected for their participation during different battle fields. Young people often wear T-shirts adorned by Emepror [[Menelik II]], Empress [[Taytu]], Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] and other notable members of the Ethiopian monarchy. Popular and [[patriotic songs]] are often played on amplifiers. Of particular note are [[Ejigayehu Shibabaw]]’s [[ballad]] dedicated to the Battle of Adwa and [[Teddy Afro]]’s popular song “Tikur Sew”, which literally translates to “black man or black person” – a poetic reference to Emperor [[Menelik II]]’s decisive African victory over Europeans, as well as the Emperor’s darker skin complexion.\n\n== Film ==\n* [[Adwa (film)|''Adwa'']] – 1999 documentary film directed by [[Haile Gerima]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Battle of Annual]]\n* [[Battle of Isandlwana]]\n* [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]]\n* [[Russo-Japanese War]]\n* [[Massacre of Elphinstone's Army]]\n* [[St. Clair's Defeat]]\n\n== Notes ==\n;Footnotes\n{{Reflist|2|group=nb}}\n\n;Citations\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Berkeley, G.F.-H.

Axis positions near [[El Alamein]], only {{convert|66|mi|km|abbr=on}} from [[Alexandria]], were dangerously close to the ports and cities of Egypt, the base facilities of the Commonwealth forces and the [[Suez Canal]]. However, the Axis forces were too far from their base at [[Tripoli]] in Libya to remain at El Alamein indefinitely, which led both sides to accumulate supplies for more offensives, against the constraints of time and distance.\n\n==Background==\n===Retreat from Gazala===\n[[File:Advance of the Panzerjager-Abteilung 39-AC1942.jpg|left|thumb|[[Afrika Korps]] tank hunters with an [[SdKfz 232#Sd.Kfz. 232 2|Sd.Kfz. 232]] armoured car in front.]]\n\nFollowing its defeat at the [[Battle of Gazala]] in Eastern [[Libya]] in June 1942, the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]], commanded by [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Neil Ritchie]], had retreated east from the Gazala line into north-western [[Egypt]] as far as [[Mersa Matruh]], roughly {{convert|100|mi|km|abbr=on}} inside the border. Ritchie had decided not to hold the defences on the Egyptian border, because the defensive plan there relied on his infantry holding defended localities, while a strong armoured force was held back in reserve to foil any attempts to penetrate or outflank the fixed defences. Since General Ritchie had virtually no armoured units left fit to fight, the infantry positions would be defeated in detail. The Mersa defence plan also included an armoured reserve but in its absence Ritchie believed he could organise his infantry to cover the minefields between the defended localities to prevent [[Axis powers|Axis]] engineers from having undisturbed access.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, p. 279</ref>\n\nTo defend the Matruh line, Ritchie placed [[10th Indian Infantry Division]] (in Matruh itself) and [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division]] (some {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} down the coast at Gerawla) under [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|X Corps]] HQ, newly arrived from Syria.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, pp. 281''n'' and 283</ref> Inland from X Corps would be [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]] with [[5th Infantry Division (India)|5th Indian Infantry Division]] (with only one infantry brigade, [[29th Indian Infantry Brigade|29th Indian]], and two artillery regiments) around Sidi Hamza about {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on}} inland, and the newly arrived [[2nd New Zealand Division]] (short one brigade, the [[6th Infantry Brigade (New Zealand)|6th]], which had been left out of combat in case the division was captured and it would form the nucleus of a new division) at Minqar Qaim (on the escarpment {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} inland) and [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|1st Armoured Division]] in the open desert to the south.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, pp. 284–285</ref> The 1st Armoured Division had taken over [[4th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters North East|4th]] and [[22nd Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|22nd Armoured Brigades]] from [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]] which by this time had only three tank regiments (battalions) between them.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, p. 281</ref>\n\n[[File:WesternDesertBattle Area1941 en.svg|thumb|Area of Western Desert Campaign 1941–1942 (Click to enlarge).]]\nOn 25 June, [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Claude Auchinleck]]—Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) [[Middle East Command]]—relieved Ritchie and assumed direct command of the Eighth Army himself.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, p. 285</ref> He decided not to seek a decisive confrontation at the Mersa Matruh position. He concluded that his inferiority in armour after the Gazala defeat, meant he would be unable to prevent Rommel either breaking through his centre or enveloping his open left flank to the south in the same way he had at Gazala.{{efn|GHQ Cairo estimated that the Axis could have as many as 519 serviceable tanks on 30 June although 339 was a more probable figure.

Only {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the south of El Alamein, the steep slopes of the [[Qattara Depression#WWII|Qattara Depression]] ruled out the possibility of Axis armour moving around the southern flank of his defences and limited the width of the front he had to defend.\n\n===Battle of Mersa Matruh===\n{{Main|Battle of Mersa Matruh}}\n\nWhile preparing the Alamein positions, Auchinleck fought strong delaying actions, first at Mersa Matruh on 26–27 June and then Fuka on 28 June. The late change of orders resulted in some confusion in the forward formations (X Corps and XIII Corps) between the desire to inflict damage on the enemy and the intention not to get trapped in the Matruh position but retreat in good order. The result was poor co-ordination between the two forward Corps and units within them. Late on 26 June, the [[90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|90th Light]] and [[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st ''Panzer'' Divisions]] managed to find their way through the minefields in the centre of the front. Early on 27 June, resuming its advance, the 90th Light was checked by British 50th Division's artillery. Meanwhile, the [[33rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|15th]] and 21st ''Panzer'' Divisions advanced east above and below the escarpment. The 15th ''Panzer'' were blocked by 4th Armoured and [[18th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|7th Motor Brigades]], but the 21st ''Panzer'' were ordered on to attack Minqar Qaim. Rommel ordered 90th Light to resume its advance, requiring it to cut the coast road behind 50th Division by the evening.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, p. 290</ref> As the 21st ''Panzer'' moved on Minqar Qaim, the 2nd New Zealand Division found itself surrounded.

Auchinleck had planned a second delaying position at [[Fukah|Fuka]], some {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Matruh, and at 21:20 he issued the orders for a withdrawal to Fuka. Confusion in communication led the division withdrawing immediately to the El Alamein position.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, p. 292–293</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-786-0327-19, Nordafrika, Erwin Rommel mit Offizieren.jpg|thumb|[[Erwin Rommel|Rommel]] in North Africa (June 1942).]]\nX Corps, having made an unsuccessful attempt to secure a position on the escarpment, were out of touch with Eighth Army from 19:30 until 04:30 the next morning. Only then did they discover that the withdrawal order had been given. The withdrawal of XIII Corps had left the southern flank of X Corps on the coast at Matruh exposed and their line of retreat compromised by the cutting of the coastal road {{convert|17|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Matruh. They were ordered to break out southwards into the desert and then make their way east. Auchinleck ordered XIII Corps to provide support but they were in no position to do so. At 21:00 on 28 June, X Corps—organised into brigade groups—headed south. In the darkness, there was considerable confusion as they came across enemy units laagered for the night. In the process, 5th Indian Division in particular sustained heavy casualties, including the destruction of the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade at Fuka.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, p. 294–295</ref> Axis forces captured more than 6,000 [[Prisoner of war|prisoners]], in addition to 40 tanks and an enormous quantity of supplies.<ref>Panzer Army Africa Battle Report dated 29 June 1942 K.T.B. 812 [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Battle_report_of_Panzerarmeeafrika_for_28_June_1942.jpg page 1] and [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Battle_report_of_Panzerarmeeafrika_for_29_June_1942.jpg page 2]</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Defences at El Alamein===\n[[File:Alamein1st1942 07.svg|thumb|The Western Desert Battle Area, July 1942.]]\nAlamein itself was an inconsequential railway station on the coast. Some {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the south lay the [[Ruweisat Ridge]], a low stony ridge that nonetheless gave excellent observation for many miles over the surrounding desert. {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the south of that lay the Qattara Depression. The line the British chose to defend stretched between the sea and the Qattara Depression, which meant that Rommel could outflank it only by taking a significant detour to the south and crossing the [[Sahara Desert]]. The British Army in Egypt recognised this before the war<ref>{{harvnb|Latimer|2002|p=58}}</ref> and had the Eighth Army begin construction of several \"boxes\" (localities with dug-outs and surrounded by minefields and barbed wire), the most developed being around the railway station at Alamein. Most of the \"line\", however, was just open, empty desert.<ref name=\"Playfair332\">Playfair Vol. III, p. 332</ref> Lieutenant-General [[Willoughby Norrie, 1st Baron Norrie|William Norrie]] ([[General officer commanding|GOC]] [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]]) organised the position and started to construct three defended \"boxes\". The first and strongest, at El Alamein on the coast, had been partly wired and mined by [[1st Infantry Division (South Africa)|1st South African Division]]. The Bab el Qattara box—some {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on}} from the coast and {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}} south-west of the Ruweisat Ridge—had been dug but had not been wired or mined, while at the Naq Abu Dweis box (on the edge of the Qattara Depression), {{convert|34|mi|km|abbr=on}} from the coast, very little work had been done.<ref name= \"Playfair332\"/>\n\nThe British position in Egypt was desperate, the rout from Mersa Matruh had created a panic in the British headquarters at Cairo, something later called \"the Flap\". On what came to be referred to as \"Ash Wednesday\", at British headquarters, rear echelon units, and the British Embassy, the British frantically burned confidential papers in anticipation of the fall of the city. Auchinleck—although believing he could stop [[Erwin Rommel|Rommel]] at Alamein—felt he could not ignore the possibility that he might once more be outmanoeuvred or outfought. He therefore believed that, to maintain his army, plans must be made for the possibility of a further retreat whilst maintaining morale and retaining the support and co-operation of the Egyptians. Defensive positions were constructed west of Alexandria and on the approaches to Cairo while considerable areas in the Nile delta were flooded.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, pp. 333–334</ref> The Axis, too, believed that the capture of Egypt was imminent; Italian leader [[Benito Mussolini]]—sensing an historic moment—flew to Libya to prepare for his triumphal entry into Cairo.<ref>{{harvnb|Barr|2005|p=69}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:2-8 Field Regt.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ordnance QF 25-pounder|25 pdr]] guns of the 28th Field Regiment, [[Royal Artillery]] at El Alamein, 12 July 1942.]]\n\nThe scattering of X Corps at Mersa Matruh disrupted Auchinleck's plan for occupying the Alamein defences. On 29 June, he ordered XXX Corps—the 1st South African, 5th and 10th Indian  divisions—to take the coastal sector on the right of the front and XIII Corps—the 2nd New Zealand Division and 4th Indian divisions—to be on the left. The remains of the 1st Armoured Division and the 7th Armoured Division were to be held as a mobile army reserve.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, p. 295</ref> His intention was for the fixed defensive positions to channel and disorganise the enemy's advance while mobile units would attack their flanks and rear.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, pp. 332–333</ref>\n\nOn 30 June, Rommel's [[Panzer Army Africa|''Panzerarmee Afrika'']] approached the Alamein position. The Axis forces were exhausted and understrength. Rommel had driven them forward ruthlessly, being confident that, provided he struck quickly before Eighth Army had time to settle, his momentum would take him through the Alamein position and he could then advance to the Nile with little further opposition. Supplies remained a problem because the Axis staff had originally expected a pause of six weeks after the capture of Tobruk. German air units were also exhausted and providing little help against the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]]'s all-out attack on the Axis supply lines which, with the arrival of [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) heavy bombers, could reach as far as Benghazi.<ref>{{harvnb|Hinsley||p=392}}</ref> Although captured supplies proved useful, water and ammunition were constantly in short supply, while a shortage of transport impeded the distribution of the supplies that the Axis forces did have.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, p. 331</ref>\n\n===Axis plan of attack===\nRommel's plan was for the 90th Light Division and the 15th and 21st ''Panzer'' divisions of the ''[[Afrika Korps]]''—to penetrate the Eighth Army lines between the Alamein box and Deir el Abyad (which he believed was defended). The 90th Light Division was then to veer north to cut the coastal road and trap the defenders of the Alamein box (which Rommel thought was occupied by the remains of the 50th Infantry Division) and the ''Afrika Korps'' would veer right to attack the rear of XIII Corps. An Italian division was to attack the Alamein box from the west and another was to follow the 90th Light Division. The Italian XX Corps was to follow the ''Afrika Korps'' and deal with the Qattara box while the [[133 Armoured Division Littorio|133rd Armoured Division ''Littorio'']] and German reconnaissance units would protect the right flank.<ref name= \"Playfair3498\">Playfair Vol. III, p. 340</ref> Rommel had planned to attack on 30 June but supply and transport difficulties had resulted in a day's delay, vital to the defending forces reorganising on the Alamein line. On 30 June, the 90th Light Division was still {{convert|15|mi|km}} short of its start line, 21st ''Panzer'' Division was immobilised through lack of fuel and the promised air support had yet to move into its advanced airfields.<ref>{{harvnb|Hinsley||p=392—393}}</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n\n===Panzer Army Africa attacks===\n\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-783-0110-12, Nordafrika, Panzer II, Kraftfahrzeuge.jpg|thumb|A [[Panzer II]] of the ''Afrika Korps''.]]\nAt 03:00 on 1 July, 90th Light Infantry Division advanced east but strayed too far north and ran into the 1st South African Division's defences and became pinned down.<ref name=\"Playfair3498\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Barr|2005|p=81}}</ref> The 15th and 21st ''Panzer'' Divisions of the ''Afrika Korps'' were delayed by a sandstorm and then a heavy air attack. It was broad daylight by the time they circled round the back of Deir el Abyad where they found the feature to the east of it occupied by [[18th Indian Infantry Brigade]] which, after a hasty journey from Iraq, had occupied the exposed position just west of Ruweisat Ridge and east of Deir el Abyad at Deir el Shein late on 28 June to create one of Norrie's additional defensive boxes.<ref>Mackenzie (1951), p.580</ref>\n\nAt about 10:00 on 1 July, 21st ''Panzer'' Division attacked Deir el Shein. 18th Indian Infantry Brigade—supported by 23 [[Ordnance QF 25 pounder|25-pounder]] gun-howitzers, 16 of the new [[Ordnance QF 6 pounder gun|6-pounder]] anti-tank guns and nine [[Matilda II|Matilda tanks]]—held out the whole day in desperate fighting but by evening the Germans succeeded in over-running them.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, pp. 340–341</ref> The time they bought allowed Auchinleck to organise the defence of the western end of Ruweisat Ridge.<ref name= \"Mac581-2\">Mackenzie (1951), pp.581–582</ref> The 1st Armoured Division had been sent to intervene at Deir el Shein.

By the end of the day's fighting, the ''Afrika Korps'' had 37 tanks left out of its initial complement of 55.<ref name=\"Playfair341\">Playfair Vol. III, p. 341</ref>\n\nDuring the early afternoon, 90th Light had extricated itself from the El Alamein box defences and resumed its move eastward. It came under artillery fire from the three South African brigade groups and was forced to dig in.<ref name=\"Playfair341\"/>\n\nOn 2 July, Rommel ordered the resumption of the offensive. Once again, 90th Light failed to make progress so Rommel called the ''Afrika Korps'' to abandon its planned sweep southward and instead join the effort to break through to the coast road by attacking east toward Ruweisat Ridge. The British defence of Ruweisat Ridge relied on an improvised formation called \"Robcol\", comprising a regiment each of field artillery and light anti-aircraft artillery and a company of infantry. Robcol—in line with normal British Army practice for ''ad hoc'' formations—was named after its commander, Brigadier Robert Waller, the Commander Royal Artillery of the 10th Indian Infantry Division.<ref name=\"Mac582\">{{harvnb|Mackenzie|1951|p=582}}</ref> Robcol was able to buy time, and by late afternoon the two British armoured brigades joined the battle with 4th Armoured Brigade engaging 15th ''Panzer'' and 22nd Armoured Brigade 21st ''Panzer'' respectively.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, pp. 342–343</ref> They drove back repeated attacks by the Axis armour, who then withdrew before dusk.

[[Italian X Corps]], meanwhile were to hold El Mreir. By this stage the ''Afrika Korps'' had only 26 operational tanks.<ref name=\"Playfair343\">Playfair Vol. III, p. 343</ref> There was a sharp armoured exchange south of Ruweisat ridge during the morning and the main Axis advance was held.<ref name=\"Playfair343\"/> On 3 July, the RAF flew 780 sorties.{{efn|During the period 1 to 27 June the Desert Air Force flew nearly 15,400 sorties.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, p. 335</ref> Auchinleck later wrote in his official despatches \"...Our air forces could not have done more than they did to help and sustain the Eighth Army in its struggle.

The plan was that the New Zealand 2nd Division—with the remains of Indian 5th Division and 7th Motor Brigade under its command—would swing north to threaten the Axis flank and rear.<ref name=\"Mac582\"/> This force encountered the [[132 Armoured Division Ariete|''Ariete'' Armoured Division]]'s artillery, which was driving on the southern flank of the division as it attacked Ruweisat.

Heavy fire from the [[27 Motorised Division Brescia|Italian ''Brescia'' Motorised Division]] at El Mreir, however, {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of the Qattara box, checked their progress and led XIII Corps to call off its attack.<ref name=\"Mitcham113\"/>\n\n===Rommel digs in===\n[[File:Rommel with his aides.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, with his aides during the desert campaign, 1942.]]\n\nAt this point, Rommel decided his exhausted forces could make no further headway without resting and regrouping. He reported to the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] that his three German divisions numbered just 1,200–1,500 men each and resupply was proving highly problematic because of enemy interference from the air. He expected to have to remain on the defensive for at least two weeks.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, p. 344/</ref>\n\nRommel was by this time suffering from the extended length of his supply lines. The Allied [[Desert Air Force]] (DAF) was concentrating fiercely on his fragile and elongated supply routes while British mobile columns moving west and striking from the south were causing havoc in the Axis rear echelons.<ref>Clifford (1943), p.285</ref> Rommel could afford these losses even less since shipments from Italy had been substantially reduced (in June, he received {{convert|5000|ST|t|abbr=on}} of supplies compared with {{convert|34000|ST|t|abbr=on}} in May and 400 vehicles (compared with 2,000 in May).<ref name=\"NZ79\">[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Egyp-c9.html#n79 Scoullar (1955), p. 79]</ref> Meanwhile, the Eighth Army was reorganising and rebuilding, benefiting from its short lines of communication. By 4 July, the [[9th Division (Australia)|Australian 9th Division]] had entered the line in the north, and on 9 July the [[5th Indian Infantry Brigade|Indian 5th Infantry Brigade]] also returned, taking over the Ruweisat position.

Meanwhile, XIII Corps would prevent the Axis from moving troops north to reinforce the coastal sector.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, p. 345</ref> Ramsden tasked the Australian 9th Division with [[44th Royal Tank Regiment]] under command with the Tel el Eisa objective and the South African 1st Division with eight supporting tanks, Tel el Makh Khad.

Then 2nd Armoured Brigade would pass through the centre of the infantry objectives to exploit toward Deir el Shein and the Miteirya Ridge.

The two New Zealand brigades shortly before dawn on 15 July took their objectives, but minefields and pockets of resistance created disarray among the attackers. A number of pockets of resistance were left behind the forward troops' advance which impeded the move forward of reserves, artillery, and support arms. As a result, the New Zealand brigades occupied exposed positions on the ridge without support weapons except for a few anti-tank guns.<ref name=\"Playfair349\">Playfair Vol. III, p. 349</ref> More significantly, communications with the two British armoured brigades failed, and the British armour did not move forwards to protect the infantry. At first light, a detachment from 15th ''Panzer'' division's 8th ''Panzer'' Regiment launched a counter-attack against New Zealand 4th Brigade's 22nd Battalion. A sharp exchange knocked out their anti-tank guns and the infantry found themselves exposed in the open with no alternative but to surrender. About 350 New Zealanders were taken prisoner.<ref name= \"Playfair349\"/>\n\nWhile the 2nd New Zealand Division attacked the western slopes of [[Ruweisat Ridge]], the Indian 5th Brigade made small gains on Ruweisat ridge to the east. By 07:00, word was finally got to 2nd Armoured Brigade which started to move north west. Two regiments became embroiled in a minefield but the third was able to join Indian 5th Infantry 5th Brigade as it renewed its attack. With the help of the armour and artillery, the Indians were able to take their objectives by early afternoon.<ref name=\"Playfair349\"/> Meanwhile, the 22nd Armoured Brigade had been engaged at Alam Nayil by 90th Light Division and the ''Ariete'' Armoured Division, advancing from the south.

By 15:00, the 3rd Reconnaissance Regiment and part of 21st ''Panzer'' Division from the north and 33rd Reconnaissance Regiment and the Baade Group comprising elements from 15th ''Panzer'' Division from the south were in place under Lieutenant-General (''[[General der Panzertruppe]]'') [[Walther Nehring]].<ref name=\"Playfair350\">Playfair Vol. III, p. 350</ref> At 17:00, Nehring launched his counter-attack. 4th New Zealand Brigade were still short of support weapons and also, by this time, ammunition. Once again, the anti-tank defences were overwhelmed and about 380 New Zealanders were taken prisoner including Captain [[Charles Upham]]<ref name=\"Playfair350\"/> who gained a second [[Victoria Cross]] for his actions including destroying a German tank and several guns and vehicles with grenades despite being shot through the elbow by a machine gun bullet and having his arm broken. At about 18:00, the brigade HQ was overrun. At about 18:15, 2nd Armoured Brigade engaged the German armour and halted the Axis eastward advance. At dusk, Nehring broke off the action.<ref name=\"Playfair350\"/>\n\nEarly on 16 July, Nehring renewed his attack. Indian 5th Infantry Brigade pushed them back but it was clear from intercepted radio traffic that a further attempt would be made. Accordingly, strenuous preparations to dig in anti-tank guns were made, artillery fire plans organised and a regiment from 22nd Armoured Brigade was sent to reinforce 2nd Armoured Brigade.<ref name= \"Playfair351\"/> When Nehring's renewed attack came late in the afternoon, it was repulsed. After the battle, the Indians counted 24 destroyed tanks, as well as armoured cars and numerous anti-tank guns left on the battlefield.<ref>Bharucha and Prasad (1956), p. 422</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Barr|2005|pp=143–146}}</ref>\n\nIn three day's fighting, the Allies captured more than 2,000 Axis prisoners of war, mostly from the Italian ''Brescia'' and ''Pavia'' Divisions; the New Zealand division suffered 1,405 casualties.<ref>{{harvnb|Barr|2005|pp=118–142}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Scoullar|1955|pp=232–298}}</ref> The fighting at Tel el Eisa and Ruweisat had seen the destruction of three Italian divisions and forced Rommel to redeploy his armour from the south and made it necessary to lay minefields in front of the remaining Italian divisions and stiffen them with detachments of German troops.<ref name=\"Hinsley405\"/>\n\n===Miteirya Ridge (Ruin Ridge)===\nTo relieve pressure on Ruweisat ridge, Auchinleck ordered the Australian 9th Division to make another attack from the north. In the early hours of 27 July, the Australian 24th Brigade—supported by 44th [[Royal Tank Regiment]] (RTR) and strong fighter cover from the air—assaulted Miteirya ridge<ref name= \"Playfair351\"/> (known as \"Ruin ridge\" to the Australians). The initial night attack went well, with 736 prisoners taken, mostly from the Italian ''[[102 Motorised Division Trento|Trento]]'' and ''[[101 Motorised Division Trieste|Trieste]]'' motorised divisions. Once again, however, a critical situation for the Axis forces was retrieved by vigorous counter-attacks from hastily assembled German and Italian forces, which forced the Australians to withdraw back to their start line with 300 casualties.<ref name=\"Playfair351\"/><ref>Johnston and Stanley (2002), pp. 83–85</ref><ref>Maughan (1966), [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/19/chapters/12.pdf pp. 572–574]</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Stewart|2002|p=130}}</ref> Although the Australian Official History of the 24th Brigade's [[2/32nd Battalion (Australia)|2/32nd Battalion]] describes the counter-attack force as \"German\",<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11283.asp|publisher=Australian War Memorial|title=Australians at War: 2/32 Battalion|accessdate=27 December 2007|work=Australian War Memorial website}}</ref> the Australian historian Mark Johnston reports that German records indicate that it was the ''Trento'' Division that overran the Australian battalion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Johnston|first=Mark|title=Fighting the Enemy: Australian Soldiers and Their Adversaries in World War II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zOgMy7rBFCoC&pg=PA13|date=16 April 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-78222-7|page=13}}</ref>{{efn|Barton Maughan—Australia's official historian—has written that \"two forward platoons of the 2/32nd's left company were overrun, 22 men were taken prisoner\"<ref>[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm52/8/AWM52-8-3-36-016.pdf Maughan (1966), p. 575]</ref> but fails to shed more light on this attack.}}\n\n===Second Battle of Ruweisat Ridge (El Mreir)===\n[[File:The British Army in North Africa 1942 E14114.jpg|thumb|A 25-pdr field gun of 11th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, in action, July 1942.]]\nThe Eighth Army now enjoyed a massive superiority in material over the Axis forces: 1st Armoured Division had 173 tanks and more in reserve or in transit,<ref name=\"Playfair353\">Playfair Vol. III, p. 353</ref> including 61 [[Grant (tank)|Grants]]<ref name=\"Hinsley405\">{{harvnb|Hinsley||p=405}}</ref> while Rommel possessed only 38 German tanks and 51 Italian tanks<ref>Maughan (1966), [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/19/chapters/12.pdf p. 577]</ref><ref>Scoullar (1955), [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Egyp-c29.html#n328 p.328] and [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Egyp-c29.html#n337 p.337]</ref> although his armoured units had some 100 tanks awaiting repair.<ref name=\"Playfair353\"/>\n\nAuchinleck’s plan was for Indian Infantry 161st Brigade to attack along Ruweisat ridge to take Deir el Shein, while the New Zealand 6th Brigade attacked from south of the ridge to the El Mreir depression. At daylight, two British armoured brigades—2nd Armoured Brigade and the fresh 23rd Armoured Brigade—would sweep through the gap created by the infantry. The plan was complicated and ambitious.<ref>Scoullar (1955), [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Egyp-c29.html#n319 pp. 319–337]</ref>\n\nThe infantry night attack began at 16:30 on 21 July. The New Zealand attack took their objectives in the El Mreir depression<ref>Scoullar (1955), [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Egyp-c30.html#n338 pp. 338–351]</ref> but, once again, many vehicles failed to arrive and they were short of support arms in an exposed position. At daybreak on 22 July, the British armoured brigades again failed to advance. At daybreak on 22 July, Nehring's 5th and 8th ''Panzer'' Regiments responded with a rapid counter-attack which quickly overran the New Zealand infantry in the open, inflicting more than 900 casualties on the New Zealanders.<ref>Scoullar (1955), [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Egyp-c31.html#n352 pp. 352–363]</ref> 2nd Armoured Brigade sent forward two regiments to help but they were halted by mines and anti-tank fire.<ref name=\"Playfair355\">Playfair Vol. III, p. 355</ref>\n\nThe attack by Indian 161st Brigade had mixed fortunes. On the left, the initial attempt to clear the western end of Ruweisat failed but at 08:00 a renewed attack by the reserve battalion succeeded. On the right, the attacking battalion broke into the Deir el Shein position but was driven back in hand-to-hand fighting.<ref name=\"Playfair355\"/>\n\nCompounding the disaster at El Mreir, at 08:00 the commander of 23rd Armoured Brigade ordered his brigade forward, intent on following his orders to the letter. Major-General Gatehouse—commanding 1st Armoured Division—had been unconvinced that a path had been adequately cleared in the minefields and had suggested the advance be cancelled.<ref name=\"Playfair356\">Playfair Vol. III, p. 356</ref> However, XIII Corps commander—Lieutenant-General [[William Gott]]—rejected this and ordered the attack but on a centre line {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of the original plan which he incorrectly believed was mine-free. These orders failed to get through and the attack went ahead as originally planned. The brigade found itself mired in mine fields and under heavy fire. They were then counter-attacked by 21st Panzer at 11:00 and forced to withdraw.<ref name=\"Playfair356\"/> The 23rd Armoured Brigade was destroyed, with the loss of 40 tanks destroyed and 47 badly damaged.<ref name=\"Playfair356\"/>\n\nAt 17:00, Gott ordered 5th Indian Infantry Division to execute a night attack to capture the western half of Ruweisat ridge and Deir el Shein. 3/[[14th Punjab Regiment]] from [[9th Indian Infantry Brigade]] attacked at 02:00 on 23 July but failed as they lost their direction. A further attempt in daylight succeeded in breaking into the position but intense fire from three sides resulted in control being lost as the commanding officer was killed, and four of his senior officers were wounded or went missing.<ref name=\"Playfair357\">Playfair Vol. III, p. 357</ref>\n\n===Attack on Tel el Eisa resumed===\n[[File:Destroyed Panzer IIIs near Tel el Eisa 1942.jpg|right|thumb|Destroyed Panzer IIIs near Tel el Eisa]]\nTo the north, Australian 9th Division continued its attacks. At 06:00 on 22 July, Australian 26th Brigade attacked Tel el Eisa and Australian 24th Brigade attacked Tel el Makh Khad toward Miteirya (Ruin Ridge).<ref name=\"Playfair357\"/> It was during this fighting that [[Arthur Stanley Gurney]] performed the actions for which he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. The fighting for Tel el Eisa was costly, but by the afternoon the Australians controlled the feature.<ref name= \"Playfair357\"/><ref>Johnston and Stanley (2002), pp. 88–93 and p. 97</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bates|1992|pp=208–211}}</ref> That evening, Australian 24th Brigade attacked Tel el Makh Khad with the tanks of 50th RTR in support. The tank unit had not been trained in close infantry support and failed to co-ordinate with the Australian infantry. The result was that the infantry and armour advanced independently and having reached the objective 50th RTR lost 23 tanks because they lacked infantry support.<ref name=\"Playfair357\"/><ref>Johnston and Stanley(2002), pp. 93–96</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bates|1992|pp=212–214}}</ref>\n\nOnce more, the Eighth Army had failed to destroy Rommel’s forces, despite its overwhelming superiority in men and equipment. On the other hand, for Rommel the situation continued to be grave as, despite successful defensive operations, his infantry had suffered heavy losses and he reported that \"the situation is critical in the extreme\".<ref>Panzer Army Africa Battle Report dated 22 July 1942 K.T.B. 1220</ref>\n\n====Operation Manhood====\nOn 26/27 July, Auchinleck launched Operation Manhood in the northern sector in a final attempt to break the Axis forces. XXX Corps was reinforced with 1st Armoured Division (less 22nd Armoured Brigade), 4th Light Armoured Brigade, and 69th Infantry Brigade. The plan was to break the enemy line south of Miteirya ridge and exploit north-west. The South Africans were to make and mark a gap in the minefields to the south-east of Miteirya by midnight of 26/27 July.<ref name=\"Playfair357\"/> By 01:00 on 27 July, 24th Australian Infantry Brigade was to have captured the eastern end of the Miteirya ridge and would exploit toward the north-west. The 69th Infantry Brigade would pass through the minefield gap created by the South Africans to Deir el Dhib and clear and mark gaps in further minefields. The 2nd Armoured Brigade would then pass through to El Wishka and would be followed by 4th Light Armoured Brigade which would attack the Axis lines of communication.<ref name= \"Playfair358\">Playfair Vol. III, p. 358</ref>\n\n[[File:Valentine tank Mk3 desert.jpg|left|thumb|A Valentine in North Africa, carrying British infantry]]\nThis was the third attempt to break through in the northern sector, and the Axis defenders were expecting the attack.<ref>Barr.N, p.176; Bates.P, p.216.</ref> Like the previous attacks, it was hurriedly and therefore poorly planned.<ref>Bates.P, p.217.</ref> The Australian 24th Brigade managed to take their objectives on Miteirya Ridge by 02:00{{efn|Playfair states that the \"...timing soon fell behind, but by 3&nbsp;am the Australians had taken their objective\"<ref name= \"Playfair358\"/>}} of 27 July.<ref>Johnston.M and Stanley.P, pp.102–106; Bates.P, p.219.</ref> To the south, the British 69th Brigade set off at 01:30 and managed to take their objectives by about 08:00. However, the supporting anti-tank units became lost in the darkness or delayed by minefields, leaving the attackers isolated and exposed when daylight came. There followed a period during which reports from the battlefront regarding the minefield gaps were confused and conflicting. As a consequence, the advance of 2nd Armoured Brigade was delayed.<ref name= \"Playfair358\"/><ref>Barr.N, pp.178–179 and 181–182</ref> Rommel launched an immediate counter-attack and the German armoured battlegroups overran the two forward battalions of 69th Brigade.<ref name= \"Playfair358\"/><ref>Barr.N, pp.179–181; Johnston.M and Stanley.P, pp.107–112; Bates.P, pp.224–225.</ref> Meanwhile, 50th RTR supporting the Australians was having difficulty locating the minefield gaps made by Australian 2/24th Battalion. They failed to find a route through and in the process were caught by heavy fire and lost 13 tanks. The unsupported 2/28th Australian battalion on the ridge was overrun. The 69th Brigade suffered 600 casualties and the Australians 400 for no gain.<ref name=\"Playfair358\"/>\n\nThe Eighth Army was exhausted, and on 31 July Auchinleck ordered an end to offensive operations and the strengthening of the defences to meet a major counter-offensive.\n\n[[File:Italian high-water mark on road to Alex edited.jpg|thumb|Commemorative stone put up by the 7th [[Bersaglieri]] Regiment on the road from Alexandria to El Alamein at the high-water mark for the Italian advance.

The duties of comradeship, for me particularly as their Commander-in-Chief, compel me to state unequivocally that the defeats which the Italian formations suffered at Alamein in early July were not the fault of the Italian soldier. The Italian was willing, unselfish and a good comrade, and, considering the conditions under which he served, had always given better than average. There is no doubt that the achievement of every Italian unit, especially of the motorised forces, far surpassed anything that the Italian Army had done for a hundred years. Many Italian generals and officers won our admiration both as men and as soldiers. The cause of the Italian defeat had its roots in the whole Italian military state and system, in their poor armament and in the general lack of interest in the war by many Italians, both officers and statesmen. This Italian failure frequently prevented the realisation of my plans.|Rommel<ref>Liddell Hart (ed), 'The Rommel Papers' (London 1953), pp.261–262.</ref>}}\n\nRommel complained bitterly about the failure of important Italian convoys to get through to him desperately needed tanks and supplies, always blaming the Italian Supreme Command, never suspecting British code breaking.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gannon|first=James|title=Stealing Secrets, Telling Lies: How Spies and Codebreakers Helped Shape the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kgb14s5UNmAC&pg=PA81|date=1 August 2002|publisher=Potomac Books, Incorporated|isbn=978-1-57488-473-9|page=81}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe battle was a stalemate, but it had halted the Axis advance on [[Alexandria]] (and then [[Cairo]] and ultimately the [[Suez Canal]]). The Eighth Army had suffered over 13,000 casualties in July, including 4,000 in the 2nd New Zealand Division, 3,000 in the 5th Indian Infantry Division and 2,552 battle casualties in the 9th Australian Division but had taken 7,000 prisoners and inflicted heavy damage on Axis men and machines.<ref name=\"CM589\" /><ref name=\"Johnston03p86\"/> In his appreciation of 27 July, Auchinleck wrote that the Eighth Army would not be ready to attack again until mid-September at the earliest. He believed that because Rommel understood that with the passage of time the Allied situation would only improve, he was compelled to attack as soon as possible and before the end of August when he would have superiority in armour. Auchinleck therefore made plans for a defensive battle.<ref>{{harvnb|Hinsley||p=407}}</ref>\n\nIn early August, [[Winston Churchill]] and General [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Sir Alan Brooke]]—the [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (CIGS)—visited Cairo on their way to meet [[Joseph Stalin]] in [[Moscow]]. They decided to replace Auchinleck, appointing the XIII Corps commander, [[William Gott]], to the Eighth Army command and General [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Sir Harold Alexander]] as C-in-C Middle East Command.

With the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] victorious, it marked the watershed of the [[Western Desert Campaign]]. The [[First Battle of El Alamein]] had prevented the [[Axis powers|Axis]] from advancing further into Egypt. In August 1942, [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] Sir [[Bernard Montgomery|Bernard Law Montgomery]] took command of the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] following the sacking of [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Claude Auchinleck]] and the death of his replacement Lieutenant-General [[William Gott]] in a plane crash.\n\nThe British victory turned the tide in the [[North African Campaign]] and ended the Axis threat to [[Egypt]], the [[Suez Canal]] and the Middle Eastern and Persian oil fields via North Africa. The Second Battle of El Alamein revived the morale of the Allies, being the first major success against the Axis since [[Operation Crusader]] in late 1941. The battle coincided with the Allied invasion of [[French North Africa]] in [[Operation Torch]], which started on 8 November, as well as the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] and the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]].\n\n==Background==\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2016}}\n{{Further|Second Battle of El Alamein order of battle}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-443-1589-07, Nordafrika, Rommel in Befehlsfahrzeug.jpg|thumb|[[Erwin Rommel]] (left) in his command halftrack, [[SdKfz 250|SdKfz.250/3]].]]\nThe [[Panzer Army Africa]] (''Panzerarmee Afrika''), composed of German and Italian infantry and mechanised units under ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Erwin Rommel]], had struck deep into [[Egypt]] by 12 July 1942 after its success at the [[Battle of Gazala]]. This threatened the [[British Empire]]'s control of the [[Suez Canal]] and [[Mandatory Palestine]]. [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Claude Auchinleck]] withdrew the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] to within {{convert|80|km}} of [[Alexandria]] to a point where the [[Qattara Depression]] came to within {{convert|64|km}} of [[El Alamein]] on the coast. This gave the defenders a short front to defend and provided secure flanks because tanks could not traverse the Depression. The Axis advance was halted here in early July in the [[First Battle of El Alamein]].\n\nThe Eighth Army [[Counteroffensive|counter-offensives]] during July failed, as Rommel had dug in to allow his exhausted troops to regroup. Auchinleck called off all offensive action at the end of July to allow rebuilding the Eighth Army's strength. In early August, the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], [[Winston Churchill]], and General [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Sir Alan Brooke]]—the [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (CIGS)—visited [[Cairo]] and replaced Auchinleck as [[Commander-in-chief]] (C-in-C) [[Middle East Command]] with General [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Sir Harold Alexander]]. [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[William Gott]] was appointed to command of the Eighth Army, but he was killed when the transport plane he was travelling in was shot down by [[Luftwaffe]] fighters; Lieutenant-General [[Bernard Montgomery]] was then appointed commander of the Eighth Army.\n\nFaced with long supply lines and lacking reinforcements, and well aware of massive [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] reinforcements in men and materiel on the way, Rommel decided to strike the Allies while their build-up was incomplete. The two armoured divisions of the ''[[Afrika Korps]]'', together with a force made up of the reconnaissance units of Panzer Army Africa, led the attack but the Allies stopped them at the Alam el Halfa ridge and Point 102 on 30 August 1942. The attack failed in this second battle at the Alamein line, better known as the [[Battle of Alam el Halfa]] (commonly, but incorrectly, Alam Halfa); expecting a [[Counterattack|counter-attack]] by Montgomery's Eighth Army, Panzer Army Africa dug in.\n\nThe factors that had favoured the Eighth Army's defensive plan in the [[First Battle of El Alamein]], the short front line and the secure flanks, now favoured the [[Axis powers|Axis]] defence.<ref name= \"Bierman255\">Bierman & Smith (2002), p. 255</ref> Rommel, furthermore, had plenty of time to prepare his defensive positions and lay extensive [[minefield]]s (laying approximately 500,000 mines)<ref name= \"Bierman255\"/> and [[barbed wire]]. Alexander and Montgomery were determined to establish a superiority of forces sufficient not only to achieve a [[Breakthrough (military)|breakthrough]] but also to exploit it and destroy Panzer Army Africa. In all the previous swings of the pendulum in the [[Western Desert Campaign]] since 1941, neither side had ever had the strength after achieving victory in an offensive battle to exploit it decisively: the losing side had always been able to withdraw and regroup closer to its main supply bases.\n\nThe British had an intelligence advantage: signals intelligence from [[Ultra]] and local sources exposed the Axis order of battle, its supply position, force disposition and intentions. A reorganisation of the intelligence function in Africa in July had also improved the integration of intelligence received from all sources and the speed of its dissemination.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=425}} With rare exceptions, intelligence identified the supply ships destined for North Africa, their location or routing and in most cases their cargoes, allowing them to be attacked.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=423}} By 25 October, Panzer Army fuel stocks were down to three days' supply, of which only two days' worth were east of Tobruk. \"The Panzer Army...&nbsp;did not possess the operational freedom of movement that was absolutely essential in consideration of the fact that the British offensive can be expected to start any day\".{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=427}}\n\nSubmarine and air transport somewhat eased the shortage of ammunition and by late October, stocks amounting to 16 days supply were held in forward areas.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=427}} After six more weeks, the Eighth Army was ready, 195,000 men and 1,029 tanks began the offensive against the 116,000 men and 547 tanks of Panzer Army Africa.\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Allied plan===\n\n====Operation Lightfoot====\nMontgomery's plan was for a main attack to the north of the line and a secondary attack to the south, involving [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]] ([[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Oliver Leese]]) and [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]] (Lieutenant-General [[Brian Horrocks]]), while [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|X Corps]] (Lieutenant-General [[Herbert Lumsden]]) was to exploit the success.<ref>Greene and Massignani, p. 219</ref> With Operation Lightfoot, Montgomery intended to cut two corridors through the Axis minefields in the north. One corridor was to run south-west through the [[2nd New Zealand Division]] sector towards the centre of Miteirya Ridge, while the second was to run west, passing {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of the west end of the Miteirya Ridge across the [[9th Division (Australia)|9th Australian]] and [[51st (Highland) Division]] sectors.<ref name=\"Playfair34\">{{harvnb|Playfair||p=34}}</ref> Tanks would then pass through and defeat the German armour. Diversions at Ruweisat Ridge in the centre and also the south of the line would keep the rest of the Axis forces from moving northwards. Montgomery expected a 12-day battle in three stages: the break-in, the dogfight and the final breaking of the enemy.<ref name=\"D254\">{{harvnb|Dear|2005|p=254}}</ref>\n\nFor the first night of the offensive, Montgomery planned for four infantry divisions of XXX Corps to advance on a {{convert|26|km|mi|order=flip}} front to the Oxalic Line, over-running the forward Axis defences. Engineers would clear and mark the two lanes through the minefields, through which the armoured divisions from X Corps would pass to gain the Pierson Line. They would rally and consolidate their position just west of the infantry positions, blocking an Axis tank counter-attack. The British tanks would then advance to ''Skinflint'', astride the north–south Rahman Track deep in the Axis defensive system, to challenge the Axis armour.<ref name=\"Playfair34\"/> The infantry battle would continue as the Eighth Army infantry \"crumbled\" the deep Axis defensive fortifications (three successive lines of fortification had been constructed) and destroy any tanks that attacked them.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|pp=430–431}}{{efn|The [[Polish Mine Detector]] designed in Scotland in 1941 by the Polish engineer and signals officer, Lieutnant [[Józef Kosacki]] was to be used for the first time in action. Five hundred of these were issued to Eighth Army. The apparatus doubled the speed at which heavily mined sands could be cleared, from around {{convert|100|m|yd}} to about {{convert|200|m|yd}} an hour.<ref>{{cite book |last=Modelski |first=Tadeusz |title=The Polish Contribution to The Ultimate Allied Victory in The Second World War |location=Worthing |year=1986 |page=221}}</ref>}}\n\n====Operation Bertram====\n\n{{main article|Operation Bertram}}\n\nThe [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces practised a number of deceptions in the months before the battle to confuse the Axis command, not only as to the exact whereabouts of the forthcoming battle, but as to when the battle was likely to occur. This operation was codenamed [[Operation Bertram|Operation ''Bertram'']]. In September, they dumped waste materials (discarded packing cases, etc.) under camouflage nets in the northern sector, making them appear to be ammunition or ration dumps. The Axis naturally noticed these but, as no offensive action immediately followed and the \"dumps\" did not change in appearance, they were subsequently ignored. This allowed Eighth Army to build up supplies in the forward area unnoticed by the Axis, by replacing the rubbish with ammunition, petrol or rations at night. Meanwhile, a dummy pipeline was built, hopefully leading the Axis to believe the attack would occur much later than it, in fact, did and much further south. To further the illusion, dummy tanks consisting of plywood frames placed over jeeps were constructed and deployed in the south. In a reverse [[feint]], the tanks destined for battle in the north were disguised as supply trucks by placing removable plywood superstructures over them.<ref>{{harvnb|Lucas|1983|p=123}}</ref>\n\n====Operation Braganza====\n\n{{main article|Operation Braganza}}\n\nAs a preliminary, the [[131st Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|131st (Queen's) Infantry Brigade]] of the [[44th (Home Counties) Division|44th (Home Counties) Infantry Division]], supported by tanks from the [[4th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters North East|4th Armoured Brigade]], launched [[Operation Braganza]] attacking the [[185th Airborne Division Folgore]] on the night of 29/30 September in an attempt to capture the Deir el Munassib area. The Italian [[paratrooper]]s repelled the attack, killing or capturing over 300 of the attackers.{{sfn|Barr|2005|p=269}} It was wrongly assumed that ''[[Fallschirmjäger]]'' (German paratroopers) had manned the defences and been responsible for the British reverse. The ''Afrika Korps'' war diary notes that the Italian paratroops \"bore the brunt of the attack. It fought well and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy.\"<ref>Afrika Korps War Diary, 30 September 1942</ref>\n\n===Axis plan===\n[[File:2 Battle of El Alamein 001.png|thumb|Deployment of forces on the eve of battle.]]\nWith the failure of their offensive at Alam el Halfa, the Axis forces were now on the defensive, but losses had not been excessive. The German and Italian supply lines were over-stretched and had been relying on captured Allied supplies and equipment that had long since been consumed. Rommel had been advised by both the German and Italian staffs that his army could not be properly supplied so far from the ports of [[Tripoli]] and [[Benghazi]]. Despite these warnings, Rommel pressed ahead with his advance to Alamein and as predicted, the supply echelons could not deliver the required supplies from the ports to the front.<ref>van Creveld, p. 196.</ref> On the other hand, the British Commonwealth forces were being re-supplied with men and materials from the United Kingdom, India, Australia and New Zealand, as well as with trucks and the newly-introduced [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tanks]] from the United States. Rommel continued to request equipment, supplies and fuel, but the main focus of the German war machine was on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], and very limited supplies reached North Africa.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1980-009-34, Georg Stumme.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|left|[[Georg Stumme]] in 1940.]]\nFurthermore, Rommel was ill. In early September, arrangements were made for him to return to Germany on sick leave and for ''[[General der Panzertruppe]]'' [[Georg Stumme]] to transfer from the Russian front to take his place. Before he left for Germany on 23 September, Rommel organised the planned defence and wrote a long appreciation of the situation to the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]], once again setting out the essential needs of the Panzer Army.<ref>{{harvnb|Playfair||p=26}}</ref>\n\nRommel knew full well that the British Commonwealth forces would soon be strong enough to launch an offensive against his army. His only hope now relied on the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German forces]] fighting in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] to quickly defeat the [[Red Army|Soviet forces]] and moving south through the [[Caucasus|Trans-Caucasus]] and threatening Iran (Persia) and the Middle East. This would require large numbers of British Commonwealth forces to be sent from the Egyptian front to reinforce British forces in Iran, leading to the postponement of any offensive against his army. Using this delay, Rommel hoped to convince the German High Command to reinforce his forces for the eventual link-up between Panzer Army Africa and the German armies battling their way through southern Russia, enabling them to finally defeat the British and Commonwealth armies in North Africa and the Middle East.\n\nIn the meantime, his forces dug in and waited for the eventual attack by the British Commonwealth forces or the defeat of the Soviet Army at Stalingrad. Rommel added depth to his defences by creating at least two belts of mines about {{convert|5|km|mi}} apart which were connected at intervals to create boxes which would restrict enemy penetration and deprive British armour of room for manoeuvre. The front face of each box was lightly held by battle outposts and the rest of the box was unoccupied but sowed with mines and explosive traps and covered by enfilading fire.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|pp=432–433}} These became known as the [[Devil's gardens]]. The main defensive positions were built to a depth of at least {{convert|2|km|mi}} behind the second mine belt.<ref>{{harvnb|Playfair||pp=27–28}}</ref> The Axis laid around half a million mines, mostly [[Teller mine|Teller anti-tank mines]] with some smaller anti-personnel types (such as the [[S-mine]]).<ref name= \"Bierman255\"/><ref name=\"D254\"/> (Many of these mines were British, and had been captured at Tobruk). To lure enemy vehicles into the minefields, the Italians had a trick of dragging an axle and tyres through the fields using a long rope to create what appeared to be well-used tracks.<ref name= \"Bierman255\"/>\n\nRommel was concerned with not letting the British armour break out into the open because he had neither the strength of numbers nor fuel to match them in a battle of manoeuvre. He therefore had to try to restrict the battle to his defended zones and counter any breakthrough both quickly and vigorously. Rommel therefore stiffened his forward lines by alternating German and Italian infantry formations. Because the Allied deception measures had confused the Axis as to their likely point of attack, Rommel departed from his usual practice of holding his armoured strength in a single concentrated reserve and split it into a northern group ([[15th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzer]] and [[133rd Armoured Division Littorio|''Littorio'' Divisions]]) and a southern group ([[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st Panzer]] and [[132nd Armoured Division Ariete|''Ariete'' Divisions]]), each organised into [[Battlegroup (army)|battle groups]] in order to be able to make a quick armoured intervention wherever the blow fell and so prevent any narrow breakthroughs from being enlarged. The effect, however, was that a significant proportion of his armoured reserve was dispersed and held unusually far forward. The 15th Panzer Division had 125 operational tanks (16 Pz.IIs, 43 Pz.III Ausf H, 43 Pz.III Ausf J, 6 Pz.IV Ausf D, 15 Pz.IV Ausf F) while the 21st Panzer Division had 121 operational combat vehicles (12 Pz.IIs, 38 Pz.III Ausf H, 43 Pz.III Ausf J, 2 Pz.IV Ausf D, 15 Pz.IV Ausf F)<ref>{{harvnb|Jentz|1996|p=8}}</ref> Further back, however, Rommel did have the [[90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|90th Light]] and [[101st Motorised Division Trieste|''Trieste'' Motorised Divisions]] in reserve near the coast.<ref>{{harvnb|Playfair||pp=28–29}}</ref> Rommel believed that when the main thrust came, he could manoeuvre his troops faster than the Allies to concentrate his defences at the battle's centre of gravity. However, having concentrated his defence, he would not be able to move his forces again because of lack of fuel.<ref>{{harvnb|Watson|2007|p=20}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of their intelligence advantage, the British were well aware that Rommel would be unable to mount a defence based on his usual battle-of-manoeuvre tactics. However, no clear picture emerged of how he would fight the battle and, in the event, British plans seriously underestimated the Axis defences and the Panzer Army's power of resistance.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=431}}\n\n==Battle==\nThe Battle of El Alamein is usually divided into five phases, consisting of the break-in (23–24 October), the crumbling (24–25 October), the counter (26–28 October), Operation Supercharge (1–2 November) and the break-out (3–7 November). No name is given to the period from 29–31 October, when the battle was at a standstill.\n\n===Phase one: the break-in===\n[[File:The Campaign in North Africa 1940-1943 E18469.jpg|thumb|left|British night artillery barrage which opened the second Battle of El Alamein]]\nPrior to the main barrage, there was a diversion by the [[24th Brigade (Australia)|24th Australian Brigade]], which involved the 15th Panzer Division being subjected to heavy fire for a few minutes.<ref>{{harvnb|Latimer|2002|p=177}}</ref> Then at 21:40 (Egyptian Summer Time) on 23 October<ref>Mead, Richard, p. 304</ref> on a calm, clear evening under the bright sky of a full moon, Operation Lightfoot began with a 1,000-gun barrage.  The fire plan had been arranged so that the first rounds from the 882 guns from the field and medium batteries would land along the {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} front at the same time.{{sfn|Barr|2005|p=308}} After 20 minutes of general bombardment, the guns switched to precision targets in support of the advancing infantry.<ref name=\"Clif307\">{{harvnb|Clifford|1943|p=307}}</ref> The shelling plan continued for five and a half hours, by the end of which each gun had fired about 600 rounds, about 529,000 shells.\n\nOperation Lightfoot alluded to the infantry attacking first. Anti-tank mines would not be tripped by soldiers stepping on them since they were too light. As the infantry advanced, engineers had to clear a path for the tanks coming behind. Each gap was to be {{convert|24|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide, which was just enough to get tanks through in single file. The engineers had to clear a {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} route through the Devil's Gardens. It was a difficult task that was not achieved because of the depth of the Axis minefields.\n\n[[File:American Aircraft in RAF Service 1939-1945- Curtis Hawk 87a Kittyhawk.

The objective was to establish a bridgehead before dawn at the imaginary line in the desert where the strongest enemy defences were situated, on the far side of the second mine belt.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=438}} Once the infantry reached the first minefields, the mine sweepers, including Reconnaissance Corps troops and [[sapper]]s, moved in to create a passage for the armoured divisions of X Corps. Progress was slower than planned but at 02:00, the first of the 500 tanks crawled forward. By 04:00, the lead tanks were in the minefields, where they stirred up so much dust that there was no visibility at all, traffic jams developed and tanks bogged down. Only about half of the infantry attained their objectives and none of the tanks broke through.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=438}}\n\n[[File:Paracadutista El Alamein14.jpg|thumb|upright|Original military uniform of an Italian paratrooper of the division Folgore in 1942]]\nThe [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]] (with one Free French Brigade under command) from  XIII Corps (Lieutenant-General [[Brian Horrocks]]) made a secondary attack to the south.

He went forward himself to observe the state of affairs and, finding himself under fire, suffered a heart attack and died. Temporary command was given to Major-General [[Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma]]. Hitler had already decided that Rommel should leave his sanatorium and return to North Africa. Rommel flew to Rome early on 25 October to press the ''Comando Supremo'' for more fuel and ammunition and then on to North Africa to resume command that night of the Panzer Army Africa, which that day was renamed the German-Italian Panzer Army (''Deutsch-Italienische Panzerarmee'').<ref name= \"Playfair50\">{{harvnb|Playfair||p=50}}</ref>\n\nThere was little activity during the day pending more complete clearance of paths through the minefields.

Over 100 tanks were involved and half were destroyed by dark.

By the time they had reorganised they were well behind schedule and out of touch with the creeping artillery barrage. By daylight the brigade was out in the open taking considerable fire from well-sited tanks and anti-tank guns.

Axis forces were firmly entrenched in most of their original battle positions and the battle was at a standstill. Montgomery decided that the planned advance southward from Miteirya Ridge by the New Zealanders would be too costly and instead decided that XXX Corps—while keeping firm hold of Miteirya—should strike northward toward the coast with 9th Australian Division. Meanwhile, 1st Armoured Division—on the Australians' left—should continue to attack west and north-west, and activity to the south on both Corps fronts would be confined to patrolling.<ref name=\"Playfair47\">{{harvnb|Playfair||p=47}}</ref> The battle would be concentrated at the Kidney feature and Tel el Eisa until a breakthrough occurred.\n\n[[File:RAF Baltimore bombing El Daba airfield.jpg|thumb|right|RAF [[Martin Baltimore|Baltimore]] of No. 223 Squadron bombing El Daba airfield in support of the Alamein offensive]]\nBy early morning, the Axis forces launched a series of attacks using 15th Panzer and ''Littorio'' divisions. The Panzer Army was probing for a weakness, but without success. When the sun set, the Allied infantry went on the attack. Around midnight, 51st Division launched three attacks, but no one knew exactly where they were.

Casualties, particularly in the north, as a result of incessant artillery and air attack, had been heavy. He found that the Italian [[102 Motorised Division Trento|''Trento'' Division]] had lost 50% of its infantry and most of its artillery, 164th Light Division had lost two battalions and although the 15th Panzer and ''Littorio'' Divisions had held off the Allied armour, this had proved costly;<ref name=\"Playfair50\"/> 15th Panzer had a mere 31 tanks remaining.<ref name=\"Young, p. 261\">{{harvnb|Young||p=261}}</ref> Most other units were under strength, all men were on half rations, a large number were sick, and the entire Axis army had only enough fuel for three days.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=427}}\n\nRommel was convinced by this time that the main assault would be in the north{{sfn|Watson|2007|p=23}} and was determined to retake Point 29. He ordered a counter-attack against it by 15th Panzer, 164th Light Divisions and elements of Italian XX Corps to begin at 15:00 but (according to the British official history) under heavy artillery and air attack this came to nothing.<ref>{{harvnb|Playfair||pp=50–51}}</ref> According to Rommel this attack did meet some success, with the Italians recapturing part of what he calls Hill 28: \"Attacks were now launched on Hill 28 by elements of the 15th Panzer Division, the Littorio and a Bersaglieri Battalion, supported by the concentrated fire of all the local artillery and A.A ...

Rommel himself noted in his diary that with the sinking of ''Tergestea'' and ''Proserpina'' the battle was lost.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nMontgomery was concerned that the impetus of the offensive was waning. Although by 26 October XXX Corps' infantry had completed the capture of the planned bridgehead west of the second mine belt, the armour of X Corps, although established just beyond the infantry, had failed to break through the enemy's anti-tank defences.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=438}} He therefore decided that over the next two days, while continuing the process of attrition, he would thin out his front line to create a reserve with which to restore his momentum. The reserve was to include the New Zealand Division (with 9th Armoured Brigade under command), 10th Armoured Division and 7th Armoured Division.<ref>{{harvnb|Playfair||p=52}}</ref>\nThe attacks in the south, which lasted three days and caused considerable losses without achieving a breakthrough, were suspended.\n\n====D + 4: 27 October====\n{{main article|Outpost Snipe}}\n[[File:The British Army in North Africa 1942 E18531.jpg|thumb|Tanks of 8th Armoured Brigade waiting just behind the forward positions near El Alamein before being called to join the battle, 27 October 1942]]\nBy this time, the main battle was concentrated around Tel el Aqqaqir and the Kidney feature at the end of 1st Armoured Division's path through the minefield. A mile north-west of the feature lay Outpost Woodcock and roughly the same distance south-west lay Outpost Snipe. An attack was planned on these areas using two battalions from 7th Motor Brigade. At 23:00 on 26 October 2 Battalion, [[The Rifle Brigade]] would attack Snipe and 2nd Battalion [[King's Royal Rifle Corps]] (KRRC) would attack Woodcock. The plan was for 2nd Armoured Brigade to pass round the north of Woodcock the following dawn and 24th Armoured Brigade round the south of Snipe. The attack was to be supported by all the available artillery of both X and XXX Corps.<ref>{{harvnb|Playfair||pp=53–54}}</ref>\n\nBoth battalions had difficulty finding their way in the dark and dust. At dawn, the KRRC had not reached its objective and was forced to find cover and dig in some distance from Woodcock. 2nd Rifle Brigade had had better fortune and after following the shell bursts of the supporting artillery dug in when they concluded they had reached their objective having encountered little opposition.<ref name=\"Playfair54\">{{harvnb|Playfair||p=54}}</ref>\n\nAt 06:00, the 2nd Armoured Brigade commenced its advance and ran into such stiff opposition that, by noon, it had still not linked with the KRRC. The 24th Armoured Brigade started a little later and was soon in contact with the Rifle Brigade (having shelled them in error for a while). Some hours of confused fighting ensued involving tanks from the ''Littorio'' and troops and anti-tank guns from 15th Panzer which managed to keep the British armour at bay in spite of the support of the Rifle Brigade battlegroup's anti-tank guns.<ref name=\"Playfair54\"/> Rommel had decided to make two counter-attacks using his fresh troops. 90th Light Division was to make a fresh attempt to capture Point 29 and 21st Panzer were targeted at Snipe (the ''Ariete'' detachment had returned south).<ref name=\"Playfair55\">{{harvnb|Playfair||p=55}}</ref>\n\nAt Snipe, mortar and shell fire was constant all day long. At 16:00, Rommel launched his major attack. German and Italian tanks moved forward. Against them the Rifle Brigade had 13 6-pounder anti-tank guns along with six more from the supporting 239th Anti-Tank Battery, R.A..

Late on 27 October, the British 133rd Brigade was sent forward to recover lost positions but the next day, a good part of this force was overrun by German and Italian tanks from the Littorio and supporting 12th Bersaglieri Regiment and several hundred British soldiers were captured.{{sfn|Walker|2006|p=166}} On the night of 28/29 October, the [[Australian 9th Division|9th Australian Division]] was ordered to make a second set-piece attack. The [[20th Brigade (Australia)|20th Australian Infantry Brigade]] with 40th R.T.R. in support would push north-west from Point 29 to form a base for [[26th Brigade (Australia)|26th Australian Infantry Brigade]] with 46th R.T.R. in support,  to attack north-east to an Axis location south of the railway known as Thompson's Post and then over the railway to the coast road, where they would advance south-east to close on the rear of the Axis troops in the coastal salient. An attack by the third brigade would then be launched on the salient from the south-east.<ref name=\"Playfair58\">{{harvnb|Playfair||p=58}}</ref>\n\nThe 20th Brigade took its objectives with little trouble but 26th Brigade had more trouble. Because of the distances involved, the troops were riding on 46th R.T.R.

The infantry and tanks lost touch with each other in fighting with the 125th ''Panzergrenadier'' Regiment and a battalion of 7th ''Bersaglieri'' Regiment sent to reinforce the sector and the advance came to a halt.<ref name=\"Playfair58\"/> The Australians suffered 200 casualties in that attack and suffered 27 killed and 290 wounded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/atwar/remembering1942/alamein23/transcript.htm |title=The Battle of El Alamein, 23 October 1942|work=Remembering 1942|first=Dr. Mark|last= Johnston|publisher=Australian War Memorial, Canberra|date=23 October 2002|accessdate=15 April 2008}}</ref> The German and Italian forces that had participated in the counter-attack formed an outpost and held on until the arrival of German reinforcements on 1 November.\n\n[[File:The British Army in North Africa 1942 E18684.jpg|thumb|British Grant tank moving up to the front, 29 October 1942]]\nIt became clear that there were no longer enough hours of darkness left to reform, continue the attack and see it to its conclusion, so the operation was called off.<ref name=\"Playfair58\"/> By the end of these engagements in late October, the British had 800 tanks still in operation, while the ''Panzerarmee'' day report for 28 October (intercepted and read by Eighth Army the following evening) recorded 81 serviceable German tanks and 197 Italian.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=441}} With the help of signals intelligence information the ''Proserpina'' (carrying 4,500 tonnes of fuel) and ''Tergestea'' (carrying 1,000 tonnes of fuel and 1,000 tonnes of ammunition) had been destroyed on 26 October and the tanker ''Luisiano'' (carrying 2,500 tonnes of fuel) had been sunk off the west coast of Greece by a torpedo from a Wellington bomber on 28 October.<ref name=\"Playfair63\">{{harvnb|Playfair||p=63}}</ref> Rommel told his commanders, \"It will be quite impossible for us to disengage from the enemy.

Montgomery determined therefore that it would take place further south on a {{convert|4000|yd|m|abbr=on}} front south of Point 29. The attack was to take place on the night of 31 October/1 November, as soon as he had completed the reorganisation of his front line to create the reserves needed for the offensive (although in the event it was postponed by 24 hours).

Panzer-Division'' and on 31 October, launched four successive attacks against \"Thompson's Post\". The fighting was intense and often hand-to-hand, but no ground was gained by the Axis forces. One of the Australians killed  was Sergeant [[William Henry Kibby|William Kibby]] ([[2/48th Battalion (Australia)|2/48th Infantry Battalion]]) who, for his heroic actions from the 23rd until his death on the 31st – including a lone attack on a machine-gun position at his own initiative – was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]].<ref name= \"Playfair61\">{{harvnb|Playfair||p=61}}</ref>\n\nAgain, on Sunday, 1 November Rommel tried to dislodge the Australians, but the brutal, desperate fighting resulted in nothing but lost men and equipment.

His fuel state continued to be critical: on 1 November, two more supply ships—the ''Tripolino'' and the ''Ostia''—had been torpedoed and sunk from the air north-west of Tobruk. The shortage forced him to rely increasingly on fuel flown in from [[Crete]] on the orders of [[Albert Kesselring]], Luftwaffe ''[[OB Süd|Oberbefehlshaber Süd]]'' (''OB Süd'', Supreme Commander South), despite the restrictions imposed by heavy bombing of the airfields in Crete and the Desert Air Force's efforts to intercept the transport aircraft.<ref name=\"Playfair63\"/>\n\nRommel began to plan a retreat anticipating retiring to Fuka, some {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} west, as he had only 90 tanks remaining in stark contrast with the Allies' 800.<ref name=\"Young, p. 261\"/> Ironically, large amounts of fuel arrived at Benghazi after the German forces had started to retreat, but little of it reached the front, a fact Kesselring tried to change by delivering it more closely to the fighting forces.{{sfn|Watson|2007|p=26}}\n\n===Phase four: Operation Supercharge===\n\n====D + 10: 2 November====\n[[File:Priest of 1st Armoured Division in North Africa, 2 November 1942 (E 18869).jpg|thumb|A [[M7 Priest|Priest 105 mm self-propelled gun]] of the 1st Armoured Division preparing for action, 2 November 1942]]\nThis phase of the battle began at 01:00 on 2 November, with the objective of destroying enemy armour, forcing the enemy to fight in the open, reducing the Axis stock of petrol, attacking and occupying enemy supply routes, and causing the disintegration of the enemy army. The intensity and the destruction in Supercharge were greater than anything witnessed so far during this battle.

However, in addition to its own 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade and 28th (Maori) Infantry Battalion, the division was to have had placed under its command [[151st Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|151st (Durham) Brigade]] from 50th Division, [[152nd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|152nd (Seaforth and Camerons) Brigade]] from 51st Division and the [[133rd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|133rd Royal Sussex Lorried Infantry Brigade]].

Once they reached their objectives, {{convert|4000|yd|m|abbr=on}} distant, 9th Armoured Brigade would pass through supported by a heavy artillery barrage and break open a gap in the Axis defences on and around the Rahman track, some {{convert|2000|yd|m|abbr=on}} further forward, which the 1st Armoured Division, following behind, would pass through into the open to take on Rommel's armoured reserves.<ref name=\"Playfair64-65\"/> Rommel had ordered 21st Panzer Division from the front line on 31 October to form a mobile counterattacking force.

The first of these attacks—having been mistakenly told the enemy had withdrawn from their objectives—met stiff resistance. Failed communications compounded problems and the forward infantry elements ended up dug in well short of their objective.
