    "Three things are to be noticed at this point. First, we had to drop a lot of points (80 out of 185) to obtain a perfect race distribution matching. This is undesirable as it inherently make our conclusion statistically weaker. Secondly, by arbitrarily removing subjects, we transformed the dataset according to our personnal assumption (or prejudices) about the data: namely that the race distribution matching is more important than the other ones. Thus resulting in the third point: we had notice again a significative distribution difference in the `married`, `re74` and `re75` features. We could try to solve this problem by again trying balance these attributes explicitely, but its easy to see that we would quickly end up with very few points in our dataset.\n",
