    "In order to choose the colouring threshold for the choropleth map, we looked at some dataframe stats. Initially, we chose to place the threshold at the rate values corresponding to 25%, 50% and 75% of the european countries. However, we noticed that using such thresholds, some countries with very similar unemployment rates might have drastically different colours. Hence, we decided to plot the different rates and to place thresholds in between visible clusters. \n",

    "While trying to formalize that approach using a K-mean algorithm, we came to learn about the [Jenks natural breaks optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenks_natural_breaks_optimization) method, a algorithmic solution designed for this specific problem. Roughly, the basic principle is to find the cut that maximimizes the distance between groups' means (so that country appearing in different colors are really different) while at the same time minimizing the variance within groups (so that country in the same color can be seen as similar). Unfortunately, we argue that this method still produce quite \"unfair\" comparisons between data points (or the implementation we found were not correct).\n",

    "We finally decided that, for the scope of this homework, manual assignment of the threshold was a viable strategy, and had the advantage of being justifiable. For instance, as we are asked to compare Switzerland against other countries, it makes sense to have finer granularity around its rate value.\n",
